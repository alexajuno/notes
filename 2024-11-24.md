- **Morning Bliss:**  
    Today's weather was perfect—cool but not cold. Stepping into the sunlight brought a gentle warmth, comforting and almost nostalgic. This kind of weather usually shows up earlier in the year, so experiencing it near the end of November made it feel even more special. The quieter side of Hanoi today, with fewer people on the streets, felt serene. Despite being a bit tired from not sleeping well last night, the combination of the weather and calmness lifted my mood.
    
- **Cafe Observations:**  
    I think the seating here is more suited for eating and chatting than for studying or working. It's only my second visit to this type of place, but my impression remains the same. It's not bad for lighter tasks, so I decided to do something simple while waiting for my classmates.
    
- **Encounters:**  
    I didn’t see Mai Chi this morning; only one floor was open for seating, and she wasn’t there. On the bright side, the morning with Tuấn was pleasant. We worked together and even shared lunch, which was nice.
    
- **Work Frustrations:**  
    I had a small discussion (or maybe an argument) with the CPAD LMS backend team. Their design was flawed, and it was frustrating. Ironically, back then, I didn’t even know when to use `400 Bad Request`—something I’ve learned since!
    
- **Afternoon Reset:**  
    After heading home at 1:30 PM, I took a much-needed nap until 3:30 PM. Feeling a bit refreshed, I decided to visit Read Station. I ordered a brown coffee, which I think is coffee with a little milk, but I’m not entirely sure. Either way, it was a nice treat to round out the day.
