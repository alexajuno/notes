# Thinking, Fast and Slow

## Introduction

- We often ignore our biases and only easily spot others flaws but not our own
- Systematic errors = biases
- The book is about human thinking process and decision-making and improve the ability to identify and understand errors of judgment and choice, in others and eventually in ourselves

### Origins

- Talking about the origins of the current research results of the author
- They want to figure out the biases of researchers themselves - and the result is yes they do
- There are some small stories about how human minds work
- Even though the story about the research ain't particularly useful, I find it interesting
- And the author won a Nobel Prize in behaviral economics

### Where we are now

- Something about complex good decisions don't come from expertise
- We tend to overestimate about our understanding of this world and underestimate the role of chance
- Probably comparing cognitive thinking and intuition
- Two systems in brain: auto and controlled

### What Comes Next

- Quick intro about the book's structure
- Something about the research that I'm too lazy to read lol

## Part 1: Two Systems

### The Characters of the Story + Two Systems

- Examples from two systems
- System 1: fast decision-making, prone to biases
- System 2: slow and deliberate thinking, more accurate but energy costing
- A gorilla video: we can be blind to obvious and blind to our blindness
- Some more examples in the book about both systems -> System 1 is automatically and can't be turn off
- Constantly in system 2 is impractical. The best we can do is compromise and avoid significant mistakes

### Plot Synopsis

- Summary the recurrent theme of the book is about the two systems
- System 1 is automatic but calling System 2 when facing hard problems

### Conflict + Illusions

- System 1 is constantly doing its job, you can't prevent it, as you've seen about illusion even though you've known about it
-
