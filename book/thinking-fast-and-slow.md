# Thinking, Fast and Slow

## Introduction

- We often ignore our biases and only easily spot others flaws but not our own
- Systematic errors = biases
- The book is about human thinking process and decision-making and improve the ability to identify and understand errors of judgment and choice, in others and eventually in ourselves

### Origins

- Talking about the origins of the current research results of the author
- They want to figure out the biases of researchers themselves - and the result is yes they do
- There are some small stories about how human minds work
- Even though the story about the research ain't particularly useful, I find it interesting
- And the author won a Nobel Prize in behaviral economics

### Where we are now

- Something about complex good decisions don't come from expertise
- We tend to overestimate about our understanding of this world and underestimate the role of chance
- Probably comparing cognitive thinking and intuition
- Two systems in brain: auto and controlled

### What Comes Next

- Quick intro about the book's structure
- Something about the research that I'm too lazy to read lol

## Part 1: Two Systems

In Part I of Thinking, Fast and Slow, Daniel Kahneman introduces the foundational concepts of two types of thinking that guide human behavior: System 1 (fast, automatic, and instinctual thinking) and System 2 (slow, deliberate, and effortful thinking). Here’s a breakdown of the key ideas:

    System 1: The Automatic Thinker:
        System 1 operates with speed and minimal effort, handling routine tasks that require little conscious thought. It’s the part of the mind responsible for quick reactions and snap judgments, like instantly recognizing a familiar face or detecting anger in someone’s tone.
        It relies on patterns and associations, drawing from stored memories and experiences to make fast decisions without analyzing each detail. This system is often efficient but prone to errors when the context changes or when tasks require deeper thought​

    .

System 2: The Deliberate Thinker:

    System 2 takes over when tasks demand attention and logical thinking. For instance, solving a complex math problem or making a careful decision requires System 2’s deliberate, step-by-step approach.
    Unlike System 1, System 2 is more flexible but consumes more mental energy. Engaging System 2 can create physical effects, such as increased pupil dilation and heart rate, as the brain exerts more effort to solve complex problems​

    .

Interactions and Conflicts Between the Systems:

    Kahneman explains how System 1 and System 2 interact, with System 1 usually leading by default. For most quick, day-to-day decisions, System 2 simply endorses the conclusions of System 1. However, when faced with more complex or unfamiliar situations, System 2 steps in to avoid potential mistakes.
    This division of labor is generally effective but can lead to predictable biases, as System 1’s quick reactions sometimes overshadow System 2’s slower, more rational approach. For example, System 1 might jump to conclusions based on stereotypes, while System 2 would need to actively challenge these assumptions to make an unbiased decision​

    .

Useful Fictions of Agents:

    Kahneman presents the systems as characters in a story to help illustrate how they work. While these “agents” are fictional, he uses them as a narrative device to make complex psychological processes more understandable​

## Part 2: Heuristics and Biases

In Part II, Heuristics and Biases, Kahneman delves into how our reliance on mental shortcuts, or heuristics, often leads to predictable biases in our judgments and decisions. Here’s a detailed summary of the main heuristics he covers:

    Representativeness Heuristic:
        Kahneman describes the representativeness heuristic as our tendency to judge the probability of an event based on how much it resembles our mental prototype, rather than on statistical reality. For example, people might classify someone as a librarian rather than a farmer based solely on personality traits that seem more “librarian-like” despite actual base rates that favor the other choice. This often leads to base rate neglect, where individuals ignore relevant statistical information​

    .

Availability Heuristic:

    The availability heuristic occurs when people assess the frequency or probability of an event based on how easily examples come to mind. Kahneman notes that memorable or emotionally charged events (like dramatic news stories) make certain outcomes seem more common than they are. This often results in skewed perceptions, as individuals mistake ease of recall for actual frequency​

​

    .

Anchoring and Adjustment:

    In uncertain situations, people often rely on an initial anchor, or reference point, and make adjustments around it, even if the anchor is arbitrary. For example, if asked whether Gandhi lived to be 120, individuals might then guess his actual age at death closer to 120 than if the anchor had been set lower. Kahneman explains that anchors can subtly manipulate numerical estimates, leading people to favor figures closer to the initial anchor​

​

    .

Substitution:

    When faced with a complex question, individuals frequently substitute it with a simpler one. For example, instead of evaluating a politician's qualifications objectively, they may answer an easier question, such as whether they find the candidate likable. This substitution often leads to oversimplification and biases, as individuals respond based on the substituted question rather than the original one​

​

        .

These heuristics reveal how cognitive shortcuts, while useful, systematically distort judgments and decision-making. Kahneman suggests that a better understanding of these biases could improve decision-making, particularly in areas where judgments are clouded by emotional or intuitive influences.

## Part III: Overconfidence

In Part III of _Thinking, Fast and Slow_, titled **Overconfidence**, Kahneman explores how individuals tend to overestimate their knowledge and abilities, especially in situations involving prediction and judgment. Here’s a detailed summary of the main ideas:

1. **The Illusion of Understanding**:

   - Kahneman explains that humans are drawn to narratives that simplify and explain past events, often attributing them to skill, talent, or clear intentions. This “narrative fallacy” leads us to believe we understand the causes of success or failure better than we actually do, and it often dismisses the role of luck and randomness.
   - He highlights this with examples of the financial world, where people confidently forecast market trends based on seemingly coherent stories about the economy, ignoring the high level of unpredictability【118:8†source】.

2. **The Illusion of Validity**:

   - This illusion refers to the confidence people have in the accuracy of their judgments, even when they lack supporting evidence. Kahneman recounts his experience evaluating Israeli army cadets, where he found that observers were overly confident in their ability to predict a cadet's success from limited information. The illusion of validity persists even when people are aware of their poor track record in making such predictions【118:17†source】【118:11†source】.

3. **The Illusion of Skill**:

   - Kahneman challenges the belief that skill can reliably predict success in environments where luck plays a significant role, like stock trading. He shows that professional stock pickers, despite their expertise, often fail to outperform random selection. The financial industry, Kahneman argues, often operates under an illusion of skill, where individuals believe they have more control or understanding than they actually do【118:19†source】.

4. **The Planning Fallacy**:

   - This cognitive bias involves underestimating the time, costs, and risks of future actions, while overestimating their benefits. Kahneman explains that people tend to create overly optimistic plans because they focus on the desired outcome rather than considering the obstacles and uncertainties involved. He notes that a remedy for this bias is the “outside view,” which involves considering how similar projects have fared rather than relying solely on an optimistic, internal perspective【118:15†source】.

5. **Competition Neglect and Overly Optimistic Predictions**:
   - Kahneman discusses how individuals and companies often overlook the actions and successes of their competitors, focusing narrowly on their own strengths. This “competition neglect” leads people to overestimate their chances of success, ignoring the fact that others are working toward the same goals. He emphasizes that optimism and confidence can drive people toward risk-taking and innovation, but it also leads to collective mistakes and disappointment when these efforts fail【118:5†source】.

In this part, Kahneman reveals the perils of overconfidence, showing how cognitive biases can distort judgment in professional and personal decisions. His insights challenge us to adopt a more measured approach, recognizing the limits of our knowledge and understanding.
