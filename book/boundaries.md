# Boundaries

## Part 1: What are boundaries?

### 1. A Day in a boundaryless life

- Sherrie is suffering. Poor her

### 2. What does a Boundary Look Like?

- Boundaries are part of us
- It should be both open for positiveness and close for negativeness
- This book is a bit religious (talking about god and Christ and Jesus a lot, but I'm not sure what it is lol)
- Examples of boundaries:
  - Skin (physical)
  - Words: is the tool for you to communicate with others about your boundaries
  - Truth: I haven't understood this one
  - Geographical distance: 
  - Time
  - Emotional Distance
  - Other People: I haven't understood this one
  - Consequences: I'm not sure but having guessed about this
- So many thing relating to Gods, that's a bit annoying
- What are within our controls/boundaries? Kinda predictable

### 3. Boundary Problems

- Examples and categories of people with boundary problems:
  - Avoidants: I haven't understood this one, and I don't like to read about God
  - Controllers
  - Non-responsive
  - Compliant

### 4. How Boundaries are Developed

- I guess this part is about how internal and external factors formed our boundaries
- My guess was incorrect, there are a lot of new ideas here but somehow I'm too lazy to read
- To have boundaries, we need to bond with others: I kinda get the idea but the book is too religious.
- Oh, the author tells us about the life process of human beings from birth to adulthood, and how the boundaries are formed at each stage, and things that can go wrong in these stages.
- I'm a bit lazy to read, let's jump to the next part

### 5. Ten Laws of Boundaries

- I haven't read carefully but law 3 seems to be the same as law 2?
- Isn't the law 9 the same as a law about proactivity?

### 6. Common Boundary Myths

- Ok some common myths

## Part 2: Boundary Conflicts

### 7. Boundaries and your Family

### 18. A Day in a Boundary Life
