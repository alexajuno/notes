## Part I - Living in the Culturescape

### Chapter 1

- This chapter is about how cultures shape us.
- Why does rules exist, esp. unspoken rules of beliefs and cultures.
- The role of language - a tool for survival. Later on, it shaped the way we think - I agree, no need to debate on this.
- I'm not sure but going outside the culturescape requires us to take risks. I don't know. There are two main ways, slowly and steady and the high risk high return. Not sure what to play but I'll keep reading to see what he says.
- The final point, I guess, is you _might_ miss things out if not going out of normal flow. But yeah, the above note has provided my pov.
- The author disregards the safety and stability and wants to go for twists and turns.
- Somehow quitting Microsoft is a good move for the author. I mean at this point, we just can't calculate the future, but it will just be fine, however dark it might be now I guess.

### Chapter 2 - Questioning the Brules

- There are many ideas in the culturescape we are living in should be questioned.

#### Common Brules Worth Challenging
  - The first one is college degrees and grades - it's important but not the most important thing.
  - The fourth one is hard work for success - it's unlikely to be true.

#### Five ways we take on Brules

- Childhood indoctrination
- Authority figures
- The need to belong
- Social proof
- Interal insecurities

#### How to make a dent in the universe

- Some people are questioning the Brules and ready to take risks of being called crazy, make a dent in the culturescape.

#### Take the Brules by the horns

- Brule test
    - Q1: Is it based on trust and hope for humanity?
    - Q2: Does it violate the Golden Rule?
    - Q3: Did I take it on from culture or religion?
    - Q4: Is it based on rational choice or contagion?
    - Q5: Does it serve my happiness?

#### It's time to start questioning

## Part II - The Awakening

### Chapter 3 - Practice Consciousness Engineering

- Talking about replacing our beliefs/models of reality (hardware) and habits/systems for living (software)

- Some statements about beliefs and habits, quite obvious given the example of life in the Amazon jungle.

- This book often takes the quotes, the examples from famous people to prove its points. I don't know. I mean this book's starting point is about extraordinary minds, so I guess it's the way this book work, but I don't really like that.
### Chapter 4 - Rewrite your models of reality

- Talking about the model of not having enough, leads to trying to prove (I don't know how to write this better. It's not just proving, but more.ðŸ˜­)
- Some other model changes but I didn't focus to read that. Probably not interested.
- The ideas of this part are mostly around we were affected by brules, by wrong models, esp. in childhood and how changing them will help. This, yes, uhm but I wonder if the changes can be that obvious. Everything takes time.

 #### External Models of Reality
 - The first idea about human intuition, I'm not totally agree with this because yep, intuition does a lot of work for us, but actually the result often not in the control of that intuition I think. The amount of luck, a.k.a. external factors just take too much contribution here. So intuition feels like unconscious heuristic algorithm that not really work. But I mean because of uncontrollable outcome, then whatever we choose, when looking back, somehow will lead to good results anyway.
- mind-body healing: I don't know what this book is trying to work on. Too broad topics here. I mean there are tons and tons of models like this. Why does he choose the mind-body? I would say the only reason is making the book longer and the author can express himself further rather than something really useful.
- happy at work: same above
- spritual but not religious: same
- Is this book some sort of promotion for his website and business? Links to the website are everywhere.
I would say that I don't really like this book so far. Not too new ideas but not focused ideas either.
### Chapter 5: Upgrade your systems for living

- This book gives me a lot of doubts and counter-points to be made. It sounds too generic and too specific at the same point, and it's not even the bigger picture that I observe.
	- For example, the writing speed. I mean it depends on so many factors of how long it takes to write a chapter , and there also the learning curve. As you progress further, you'll reach a point where the progress grow slower. I mean the idea of improving the frameworks is good but it's the sequential parts that make this book isn't that good in my pov. I guess I'll just skim  the rest instead of heavy reading. A bit disappointed.
