## Part I - Living in the Culturescape

### Chapter 1

- This chapter is about how cultures shape us.
- Why does rules exist, esp. unspoken rules of beliefs and cultures.
- The role of language - a tool for survival. Later on, it shaped the way we think - I agree, no need to debate on this.
- I'm not sure but going outside the culturescape requires us to take risks. I don't know. There are two main ways, slowly and steady and the high risk high return. Not sure what to play but I'll keep reading to see what he says.
- The final point, I guess, is you _might_ miss things out if not going out of normal flow. But yeah, the above note has provided my pov.
- The author disregards the safety and stability and wants to go for twists and turns.
- Somehow quitting Microsoft is a good move for the author. I mean at this point, we just can't calculate the future, but it will just be fine, however dark it might be now I guess.

### Chapter 2 - Questioning the Brules

- There are many ideas in the culturescape we are living in should be questioned.

#### Common Brules Worth Challenging
  - The first one is college degrees and grades - it's important but not the most important thing.
  - The fourth one is hard work for success - it's unlikely to be true.

#### Five ways we take on Brules

- Childhood indoctrination
- Authority figures
- The need to belong
- Social proof
- Interal insecurities

#### How to make a dent in the universe

- Some people are questioning the Brules and ready to take risks of being called crazy, make a dent in the culturescape.

#### Take the Brules by the horns

- Brule test
    - Q1: Is it based on trust and hope for humanity?
    - Q2: Does it violate the Golden Rule?
    - Q3: Did I take it on from culture or religion?
    - Q4: Is it based on rational choice or contagion?
    - Q5: Does it serve my happiness?

#### It's time to start questioning

## Part II - The Awakening

### Chapter 3 - Practice Consciousness Engineering

- Talking about replacing our beliefs/models of reality (hardware) and habits/systems for living (software)

- Some statements about beliefs and habits, quite obvious given the example of life in the Amazon jungle.

- This book often takes the quotes, the examples from famous people to prove its points. I don't know. I mean this book's starting point is about extraordinary minds, so I guess it's the way this book work, but I don't really like that.
