## **Software Requirements Specification**

### **1. Introduction**
- **Purpose:** The purpose of the SRS (technical guide for development).
- **Scope:** What the system will cover.
- **Definitions:** Terms and acronyms specific to the system.
- **References:** Links to the BRD and other supporting documents.

### **2. Functional Requirements**
- Detailed description of system behaviors:
  - **User Registration:** Include detailed actions (e.g., "OAuth-based login").
  - **Class Management:** What actions teachers can perform (e.g., "create classes, track progress").
  - **Q&A System:** Steps for posting, answering, and voting.
  - [Continue with other features.]

### **3. Non-Functional Requirements**
- Performance metrics (e.g., "System should support 1,000 concurrent users").
- Security measures (e.g., "Data must be encrypted using TLS").
- Usability and reliability standards.

### **4. System Models and Diagrams**
- **Use Case Diagrams:** Key user interactions (e.g., "Enroll in class").
- **Sequence Diagrams:** Interaction workflows (e.g., "Post a question and receive an answer").
- **ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram):** Database structure.

### **5. Data Requirements**
- Details of all critical data entities (e.g., `User`, `Module`, `Question`).

### **6. Constraints and Dependencies**
- Technical or platform constraints (e.g., "Cloud-hosted infrastructure").
- External dependencies (e.g., "OAuth provider for authentication").

### **7. Validation and Acceptance Criteria**
- How the system will be tested to meet business goals:
  - Functional testing of Q&A.
  - Performance testing to ensure scalability.

### **8. Appendices**
- Supporting diagrams, references, or extended explanations.
