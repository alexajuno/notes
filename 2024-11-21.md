- Thought about my approach to relationships, particularly regarding Teacher’s Day.
- Realized I value authenticity and don’t feel comfortable with surface-level expressions.
- Observed that teaching feels like any other job to me, and I focus more on the personalities and character traits of teachers rather than the job itself.
- Felt my role in relationships is more about listening than making grand gestures, which feels okay for now.
- Enjoyed the peaceful atmosphere at Read Station, which helped me reflect and focus on coding tasks for the CPAD LMS.
- Noted that milky coffee at Read Station is lighter in sweetness compared to PewPew bread shop.
