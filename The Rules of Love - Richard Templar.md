## Introduction
The author addresses the context and the common theme and ideas of the book. Lol when I read back the previous sentence, it doesn't sound to help with anything but it is how it is.
The recurring theme is real stories to prove for the rules or point of views the author had made.
## Part I: Rules for finding Love
### Rule 1: Be Yourself
- Reading this make me think about what are my core personality since then. Because I've changed my mind so much after so many events, constantly expanding my horizons.
- Also a reminder for me to never consider the thoughts of changing someone's behaviors or personalities.
### Rule 2: Get Over it before you get on with it
- It's a bad thing for starting a new relationship while healing due to many reasons lol
### Rule 3: Can't enjoy a partner if you ain't happy on your own
- From this part, I saw the recurring theme I've noted in the Introduction, so I'll read this book real quick, skimming through the rules and ideas.
### Rule 7: Donâ€™t Keep Making the Same Mistakes
About loving patterns of choosing someone to love. Uh yeah you have to let go all of your fantasy and pay attention to things that makes a relationship doesn't work out
### Rule 8: Off Limits
It's about your instincts of knowing someone not suitable to you in a sense.
I don't know, I'm getting lazy of taking notes
### Rule 9: You Can't Change People
Reading the book just made me thoughts about the past relationship more. But I guess, it is how it is. It ended for a reason.
