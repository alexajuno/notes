## Build System

- Starter packages
- Inversion of Control? Hand over objects management to a framework
- Aspect-Oriented Programming
- Transaction Management?
- In Spring Boot for web, we have both DTO and DAO. Why would we need DTO, and why Spring Boot doesn't support automatically mapping?
- Annotations: Component, Bean
- User profiles?
- Spring Batch and batch processing?

- How could a framework manage such a pool of objects in IoC?
- So, Spring Boot supports AOP via @aspect annotation? Do we have any deeper architecture underlying?
- @configuration?
