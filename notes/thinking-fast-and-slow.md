## Part 1: Two Systems

### The Characters of the Story + Two Systems

- Examples from two systems
- System 1: fast decision-making, prone to biases
- System 2: slow and deliberate thinking, more accurate but energy costing
- A gorilla video: we can be blind to obvious and blind to our blindness
- Some more examples in the book about both systems -> System 1 is automatically and can't be turn off
- Constantly in system 2 is impractical. The best we can do is compromise and avoid significant mistakes

### Plot Synopsis

- System 1 is automatic but calling System 2 when facing hard problems

### Conflict + Illusions

- System 1 is constantly doing its job, you can't prevent it, as you've seen about illusion even though you've known about it
