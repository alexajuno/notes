In the morning, I texted Ngan about she had not told me anything yesterday. And she was upset because I didn't tell her anything. Uh then I told her I would want some time being alone.
I went to Read Station this morning. It's the same as ever - some productive hours with decent atmosphere. There was a fire safety drill in the opposite building. It's looking fun. I thought there was a fire at first.
