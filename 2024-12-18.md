## Daily Notes

- Roommate Issue: I’ve been thinking about how unfair it feels to split the internet bill equally when my roommate is the one using it the most for gaming. Their noise makes it hard for me to stay in the room. I considered negotiating to make the split more balanced next time.
- Thoughts on Negotiation: Negotiating seems very important, yet I’ve realized I often struggle with it and need external help. I also noticed how emotions, like feeling upset, can act as tools to protect myself during a negotiation but quickly disappear once the issue is resolved.
- Relationship Doubts: I questioned my feelings for my girlfriend. Am I with her out of true love, or is it just the comfort of having someone always by my side?
- Emotions as Tools: This conversation made me reflect on how unreliable emotions can be. They shift based on context, which is both helpful and unsettling.
