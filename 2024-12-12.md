## Daily Notes

- I didn't have much sleep last night, I don't know why but I woke up at 4:30am, and I felt like I can't get back to sleep anymore, maybe because of being hungry.
- 7 Cups supports Vietnamese finally. I can register my Vietnamese phone number and start chatting now.
- I went back to Kham Thien Giam book and coffee shop again today after a crowded day yesterday and I couldn't find a sit. Everything here seems quite good, and cheaper than Read Station. Even though there are no good chairs, so it's best to be a co-working space.
- I was too hungry at the afternoon, so I went back home and bought some food. Then take rest.
- The story is a bit long and I'm too lazy to record it right now. Sorry. I had an experience with the UX/UI project and the team. I'm not sure what to think of that, but mostly in the afternoon, I spent time for sleeping, watching videos and designing the project.
