# Route Groups

- Organizing routes by hiding a folder from route segment
- But the nested layouts, I haven't understood yet, because I haven't used that technique.

## Convention

- Wrapping a folder name with ()

## Examples

- Opting specific segments into the same layout
- Creating multiple root layouts
