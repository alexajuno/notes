### 1. The Suprising power of Atomic Habits

- Maybe about habits create compounding, clarifying good things in life made from habits that compound over time and
- Story of an ordinary cycling team with expanding the self-margin bit by bit, become best team of cycling by winning multiple tournaments

#### Why small habits make a big difference

- About compounding. I totally agree with the author at this point
- Compounding will lead to breakthrough
- Apply to bad habits too

#### Forget about goals, focus on systems instead

- Problems with goals
  - Both winners and losers have goals
  - Achieving a goal is only a momentary change
  - Goals restrict your happiness

#### A system of atomic habits

- The problem isn't with the motive for changing, but with the system you are using to change

### 2. How habits shape your identity (and vice versa)

- Probably talking about impacts yielded from having habits. They transform your life.
- Probably explain in detail how a person change

- Four steps
  - Cue
  - Craving
  - Response
  - Reward

#### The habit loop

#### The 4 laws of behavior change

- They are the rest of this book

## The First Law: Make it Obvious

- Starting point of creating new habits
  - Affecting factors
  - Does motivation matter? And if it does, then what do we do with it, or how to create one?
  -

### 4. The man who didn't look right

- Awareness about your habit
- It's about human brain is a prediction machine. With subtle cues, it can predict very well unconciously

#### The Habits Scorecard

- Habits make us overlook our behavior
- This part is about acknowledging even the smallest habits in our daily lives, scoring them according to your identity. We may change them but that's the story of upcoming chapters

### 5. The best way to start a new habit

- Implementation intentions: If X arises, I'll do Y
- It's about just pick a time and a location for an action toward the habit building

#### Habit stacking

- probably about taking small steps gradually
- I was wrong, it's about pairing the new habit with an old one
- Diderot's effect
- After [current habit], I will [new habit]

### 6. Motivation is Overrated; Environment Often Matters More

#### Before After

- Env is an invisible hand that shapes human behavior
- However unique we are, certain actions will be triggered in certain env

#### How to design your env

- lemme guess, it's about if you get good feelings after finish an activity, you will likely to make it a habit
- Experiment and conclusion about dopamine, a neurotransmitter
- Dopamine generated not only when we experience the pleasure, but also when we anticipate it

#### The Dopamine Spike

- Researches shown that dopamine in crave stage is higher than reward stage
- Conclusion: it's the urges, the wants that make we take actions

#### How to use temptation bundling to make your habits more attractive

- Temptation bundling: pair what you want with what you need to do
- Formula of habit stacking + temptation bundling
  - After &lt;current habit&gt;, I'll &lt;habit I need&gt;
  - After &habit I need&gt;, I'll &lt;habit I want&gt;

### 9. The Role of Family and Friends in Shaping Your Habits

#### The seductive pull of social norms

- I guess based on the tile
- Some habits and beliefs are passed down on us through family, school, friends
- Three groups
  - The close
  - The many
  - The powerful
- Join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal and you already have common with the group
- Getting along with others is our natural mode

### 10. Find and fix the causes of your bad habits

#### Where cravings come from

- We have reasons for craving something
- Underlying motives
- We constantly predict things and have urges to fill the gap called craves made by our prediction

- Have to -> get to
- Change your perception and wire the hard habits with enjoyment
- Using motivation ritual can help you get into "focus mode"

## The Third Law: Make it Easy

### 11. Walk Slowly, but Never Backward

- I think this idea can be applied to so many things. I mean you go fast but keep go wrong is not as good as go as slowly as possible but being correct for each small step
- Start action against just sitting with planning. Just go and don't be afraid of failures

#### How long does it take to form a new habit?

- Habits create physical changes in our brain

#### The Habit Line

- It's a curve that indicates how repetition over time can increase automaticity and up to a point called "habit line", it becomes a habit

#### Walking 10 minutes per day

- Frequency matters more than time

### 12. The Law of Least Effort

#### The shape of human behavior

- Probably mean that people lean to easy action
- Our real motivation is being lazy and to do what is convenient
- We are capable of doing hard things, but there are good and bad days. And the idea is to prepare for bad days when we don't have the amount of will energy to overcome the hardship.

#### How to achieve more with less effort

- Practice env design
  - Make the action to form the habit you want as easy as possible

#### Prime the environment for future use

- Increase or decrease the friction for actions

### 13. How to stop procrastinating by using the two-minutes rules

- Every day, the are handful of moments that deliver an outsized impact

#### Decisive moment

- Haha. The best time stop is when you are going good (on an action)
- Just start at a really small point (two-minute rule)

    - attractive
      - we see the progresses

      - the x-crossing is satisfying
- After [current habit], I will [track the habit]

#### How to recover quickly when your habits break down

- Simple rule: never miss twice
- The first rule of compounding: "never interrupt it unnecessarily"

#### Knowing when (and when not) to track a habit

- Choosing wrong measurement (esp. by numbers) can lead to wrong behaviors
- Goodhart's Law: when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure

### 17. How an accountability partner can change everything

- Increase punishment or unsatisfying feeling on bad behaviors

## Advanced Tactics

### 18. The Truth about Talents

- The secret to increase your odds of success is to choose the right field of competition

- You have to fall in love with boredom

### 20. The downside of Creating Good Habits

- You get into mindless autopilot and let feedbacks and mistakes slide
- Research've shown that once you've reached a certain mastery, your performance can be declined over time. But minor dip doesn't affect that. Just good enough to go.
- For elite level, you need: habits + deliberate practice = mastery

#### How to review your habits and make adjustments

- A basketball team with high expectations wasn't successful
- The coach of this team created a program for player's performance tracking
- Something about basketball that I don't understand but it's about many aspects of basketball, not only statistic measures like scores
- the reflections were made weekly, yearly
- So this part is about advanced tactics, so yeah, beside forming habits, you have to fine-tuning them

- I haven't understood this part. I mean it's about reflection but I don't understand how it solves the problem stated above

#### How to break the beliefs that hold you back

- Don't let any single aspect of your identity overwhelm you, becauses it will make you having less adaptability to new challenges and improvements
- At this point, I don't think it's about clinging to one aspect of identity but it's about choosing the core values and core identity that having high adaptability to life
