# Thinking, Fast and Slow

## Introduction

- The book is about human thinking process and decision-making
- Something about an old research made by the author and his friend
- Something about complex good decisions don't come from expertise
- Probably comparing cognitive thinking and intuition
- Two systems in brain: auto and controlled

## Part 1: Two Systems

- Examples from two systems
- A gorilla video: we can be blind to obvious and blind to our blindness
- Some more examples in the book about both systems -> System 1 is automatically and can't be turn off
- Constantly in system 2 is impractical. The best we can do is compromise and avoid significant mistakes
