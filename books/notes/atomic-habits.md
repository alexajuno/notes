## The Fundamentals: Why Tiny Changes make a big difference

- Power of habits and the overall process to create a habit

### 1. The Suprising power of Atomic Habits

- Maybe about habits create compounding, clarifying good things in life made from habits that compound over time and
- Story of an ordinary cycling team with expanding the self-margin bit by bit, become best team of cycling by winning multiple tournaments

#### Why small habits make a big difference

- About compounding. I totally agree with the author at this point
- Compounding will lead to breakthrough
- Apply to bad habits too

#### Forget about goals, focus on systems instead

- Problems with goals
  - Both winners and losers have goals
  - Achieving a goal is only a momentary change
  - Goals restrict your happiness

#### A system of atomic habits

- The problem isn't with the motive for changing, but with the system you are using to change

### 2. How habits shape your identity (and vice versa)

- Probably talking about impacts yielded from having habits. They transform your life.
- Probably explain in detail how a person change

#### Three layers of behavior changes

- Including identity, process, outcome
- Focus on changing identity first

#### The two-step process to change your identity

- What you do set who you are
- Two-step
  - Decide the type of person you want to be
  - Prove it to yourself with small wins

#### The real reason habits matter

- You have choice on your identity every moment

### 3. How to Build better habits in 4 simple steps

- Behaviors lead to satisfaction tend to be repeated

#### Why your brain build habits

- Probably telling about our brain automates tasks to reduce amount of thinking
- Habits are mental shortcuts for repeated problems
- Misunderstanding about habits restrict freedom. It's on the reverse instead.

#### The Science of how habits work

- Probably explain about how a brain create a habit (both good and bad ones)
- Four steps
  - Cue
  - Craving
  - Response
  - Reward

#### The habit loop

- Probably rewards are associated with cues, created a loop
- Problem phase and solution phase

#### The 4 laws of behavior change

- They are the rest of this book

## The First Law: Make it Obvious

- Starting point of creating new habits
  - Affecting factors
  - Does motivation matter? And if it does, then what do we do with it, or how to create one?
  -

### 4. The man who didn't look right

- Awareness about your habit
- It's about human brain is a prediction machine. With subtle cues, it can predict very well unconciously

#### The Habits Scorecard

- Habits make us overlook our behavior
- This part is about acknowledging even the smallest habits in our daily lives, scoring them according to your identity. We may change them but that's the story of upcoming chapters

### 5. The best way to start a new habit

- Implementation intentions: If X arises, I'll do Y
- It's about just pick a time and a location for an action toward the habit building

#### Habit stacking

- probably about taking small steps gradually
- I was wrong, it's about pairing the new habit with an old one
- Diderot's effect
- After [current habit], I will [new habit]

### 6. Motivation is Overrated; Environment Often Matters More

#### Before After

- Env is an invisible hand that shapes human behavior
- However unique we are, certain actions will be triggered in certain env

#### How to design your env

- Just make it obvious

#### The Context is the Cue

- Think about things not as objects, but as relationships
- One context/object per habit e.g workspace just for work, kitchen is for home life

### 7. The Secret to Self-Control

- It's about how to practice self-control: the most practical way is to remove cues that leads to the habit

## The Second Law: Make It Attractive

### 8. How to make a habit irresistable

#### The Dopamine-driven feedback loop

- lemme guess, it's about if you get good feelings after finish an activity, you will likely to make it a habit
- Experiment and conclusion about dopamine, a neurotransmitter
- Dopamine generated not only when we experience the pleasure, but also when we anticipate it

#### The Dopamine Spike

- Researches shown that dopamine in crave stage is higher than reward stage
- Conclusion: it's the urges, the wants that make we take actions

#### How to use temptation bundling to make your habits more attractive

- Temptation bundling: pair what you want with what you need to do
- Formula of habit stacking + temptation bundling
  - After &lt;current habit&gt;, I'll &lt;habit I need&gt;
  - After &habit I need&gt;, I'll &lt;habit I want&gt;

### 9. The Role of Family and Friends in Shaping Your Habits

#### The seductive pull of social norms

- I guess based on the tile
- Some habits and beliefs are passed down on us through family, school, friends
- Three groups
  - The close
  - The many
  - The powerful
- Join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal and you already have common with the group
- Getting along with others is our natural mode

### 10. Find and fix the causes of your bad habits

#### Where cravings come from

- We have reasons for craving something
- Underlying motives
- We constantly predict things and have urges to fill the gap called craves made by our prediction

#### How to reprogram your brain to enjoy hard habits

- Have to -> get to
- Change your perception and wire the hard habits with enjoyment 
- Using motivation ritual can help you get into "focus mode"

## The Third Law: Make it Easy

### 11. Walk Slowly, but Never Backward

- I think this idea can be applied to so many things. I mean you go fast but keep go wrong is not as good as go as slowly as possible but being correct for each small step
- Start action against just sitting with planning. Just go and don't be afraid of failures

#### How long does it take to form a new habit?

- 

#### The Habit Line?

#### Walking 10 minutes per day

- Something about frequency create habit, not the amount of time
