# Software Engineering - A Practicioner Approach

## Chapter 1: Software and Software Engineering

- A conversation about cloud computing is the new generation of software
- A short introduction to software and software engineering

### 1.1 The Nature of Software

#### 1.1.1 Defining Software

- Software is developed or engined
- Software doesn't wear out
- Industry is moving toward component-based construction, most software continues to be custom built

#### 1.1.2 Software Application Domains

- Many domains that I don't read

#### 1.1.3 Legacy Software

- Just don't do anything until significant changes are required. More in chapter 29

### 1.2 The Unique Nature of WebApps

- So many aspects of webapps that I don't remember

### 1.3 Software Engineering

- software requirements
  - Understand the problem before develope a software solution
  - Design is required for sophisticated software
  - Software need to be high quality because people depend on it
  - Maintainability
  => Software engineering
- Software engineering: layered technology
  - quality focus: bedrock
  - process: foundation
  - methods
  - tools

### 1.4 The Software Process

- Providing a high level approach to all project's sizes and allow people to choose the actions and tasks to fit that process framework
- Encompass five activites
  - Communication
  - Planning
  - Modeling
  - Construction
  - Deployment
- Umbrella activities?
- Overall the process application is very flexible but I'm too lazy to read and memorize

### 1.5 Software Engineering Practice

#### 1.5.1 The Essence of Practice

- Sequential steps in software engineering practice

#### 1.5.2 General Principles

- Some nice principles but I won't memorize them

### 1.6 Software Myths

- Management's Myth
- Customer's myth
- practicioner's myth

## Part 1: The Software Process

### Chapter 2: Process Models

#### 2.1 A Generic Process Model

- framework activity -> actions -> tasks
- types of process flow: linear, iterative, evolutionary, parallel

##### 2.1.1 Defining a framework activity

##### 2.1.2 Identifying a task set

##### 2.1.3 Process Patterns

- It's like a playbook in cybersecurity

#### 2.2 Process Assessment and Improvement

- Some standards for software assessment

#### 2.3 Prescriptive Process Models
