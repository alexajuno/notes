- Note: I think this is similar to win-win and win-lose perspective mentioned in Covey's 7 habits
- Understanding what makes giving both so powerful and dangerous is the main point of this book
- Author also stated about spotting takers just by looking at signs. Note: but I'm kinda disagree with point of view. We hardly can understand a person until we spent time with them or finding out about them

- So far, it's giving that yeilds the most results for the society
- Givers when dealing with takers?

## 3 The Ripple Effect

- Geogre Meyer was weird, poor but later succeeded

- Research on creativity, and concluded that the more creative an individual, the more self-centric they are

- Putting the group's goals and missions first, rather than self-interest
- Givers having high credit for what they've done
- The responsibility bias in relationships. People oftens give themselves higher credit than other and the story of Jonas Salk
