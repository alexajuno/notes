## Understanding of the World

I believe the world is a complex interplay of individual actions and systemic structures. Human beings are inherently social creatures, whose behaviors are influenced by both personal desires and societal expectations. While we have control over our choices and attitudes, we operate within broader economic, cultural, and political systems that shape our opportunities and challenges.

I recognize that while we can't control external events or the actions of others, we can control our responses to them. Embracing this understanding empowers me to focus on personal growth and contribution, rather than being constrained by circumstances beyond my influence.

### Philosophical Influences

#### Alfred Adler's Individual Psychology

Adler's Individual Psychology emphasizes the importance of striving for significance and the impact of social connections on personal development. From his teachings, particularly as presented in "The Courage to Be Disliked," I've embraced the concept that our perceptions shape our reality. Adler posits that we are not merely products of our past experiences but have the power to choose our paths moving forward.

Key takeaways from Adler that influence my philosophy:

- **Holism**: Viewing individuals as whole beings interconnected with society.
- **Purposefulness of Behavior**: Understanding that all actions are goal-directed.
- **Social Interest**: Valuing community and cooperation over competition.
- **Overcoming Inferiority**: Striving to improve oneself not out of inadequacy but from a desire for growth.

These principles encourage me to take responsibility for my life, cultivate meaningful relationships, and contribute positively to society.

#### Karl Marx's Philosophical Contributions

Marx's analysis of capitalism and his critique of societal structures have profoundly impacted my understanding of social and economic dynamics. While I acknowledge that some of his predictions did not materialize as expected, I find value in his fundamental ideas about class struggle, the exploitation inherent in unchecked capitalism, and the importance of collective action.

Key insights from Marx that resonate with me:

- **Material Conditions Influence Consciousness**: Recognizing how economic factors shape societal values and individual opportunities.
- **Alienation**: Understanding how disconnect from the products of one's labor can lead to a sense of dissatisfaction and powerlessness.
- **Desire for Equity**: Advocating for systems that promote fairness and reduce disparities.

Marx's work inspires me to be mindful of the societal structures that impact individual lives and to strive for a more equitable world through personal actions and contributions.

## Mission Statement

To live a life of continuous growth, contribution, and fulfillment.

## Core Values

- **Integrity**: Upholding moral principles consistently in all actions.
- **Curiosity**: Maintaining a lifelong passion for learning and exploration.
- **Compassion**: Showing empathy and kindness towards others.
- **Excellence**: Striving for personal bests in all endeavors.
- **Social Responsibility**: Contributing to the well-being of society and advocating for justice.
- **Resilience**: Adapting to challenges with strength and perseverance.
- **Community**: Valuing relationships and working collaboratively towards common goals.
- **Empowerment**: Encouraging self and others to take charge of their destinies.

## Long-Term Goals

- **Achieve Financial Independence by 2030**: Enabling freedom to pursue passions and contribute to society without financial constraints.
- **Foster Lifelong Learning and Personal Growth**: Continuously seek new knowledge and experiences to broaden perspectives.
- **Build and Strengthen Community Connections**: Develop meaningful relationships and collaborative networks.

# Philosophy of Life

## Understanding of the World

I believe the world is a complex interplay of individual actions and systemic structures. Human beings are inherently social creatures, whose behaviors are influenced by personal desires, societal expectations, and their unique contexts shaped by environment, history, and circumstances. While we are equal in our inherent human value, the differences in our contexts lead to diverse experiences and opportunities.

I acknowledge that life is filled with unlimited variabilities, and the only thing we can truly focus on is the current moment. Embracing the present allows me to navigate the uncertainties of life with mindfulness and intentionality.

I recognize that while we can't control external events or the actions of others, we can control our responses to them. This understanding empowers me to focus on personal growth and contribution, rather than being constrained by circumstances beyond my influence.

### **Reflections on Financial Independence**

Considering my current status as a college student, it's important to set a realistic goal for achieving financial independence. Rather than aiming for a specific year like 2030, I recognize that building financial independence is a gradual process that typically spans over a decade or more, especially when starting from the beginning of a career.

**Realistic Steps Toward Financial Independence:**

- **Education and Skill Development**: Focus on excelling in my studies and acquiring skills that enhance employability and career prospects.
- **Career Planning**: Seek opportunities in fields that align with my values and offer growth potential.
- **Financial Literacy**: Educate myself on personal finance, investing, and budgeting to make informed decisions.
- **Savings and Investments**: Develop a habit of saving a portion of my income and investing wisely to build wealth over time.
- **Minimalist Lifestyle**: Continue embracing simplicity ("giản dị") to reduce unnecessary expenses and focus on what truly brings fulfillment.
- **Entrepreneurship and Additional Income Streams**: Explore opportunities to generate passive income or start ventures that align with my interests.

By setting a target of achieving financial independence within 10-15 years after starting my career, I allow myself a reasonable timeframe to build wealth sustainably while enjoying the journey.

### **Final Thoughts**

Incorporating these reflections, my "Philosophy of Life" now more deeply represents my understanding of the world, my values, and realistic goals aligned with my current stage in life. By focusing on the present moment and what I can control, I position myself to navigate life's uncertainties with purpose and clarity.
