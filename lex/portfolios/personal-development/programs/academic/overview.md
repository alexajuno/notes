# Program: Academic Journey

## Purpose

To navigate the remaining semesters of my undergraduate studies with renewed focus and determination, aiming to improve my GPA and lay a solid foundation for pursuing a higher degree over the next 1.5 years. This journey acknowledges my critical perspective on the college system while leveraging it to achieve my personal and academic goals.

## Context and Reflection

As a senior college student nearing the end of 2024, I recognize that my past academic laziness has impacted my GPA. While I find many classes uninspiring—often adhering to the 80/20 rule where only 20% of class time offers substantial benefit—I understand the necessity of excelling academically to open future opportunities.

I perceive college as a business entity, offering a broad spectrum of courses that may not suit everyone's interests and employing marketing strategies like scholarships to attract students. Despite these reservations, I am committed to making the most of my remaining time by focusing on what I can control: my effort and engagement.
