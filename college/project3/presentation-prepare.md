## Presentation Content (Summarized)

**Title**: JAMC Learning Platform - Design Overview

**1. Introduction (1-2 slides)**  
- **Goal**: A learning platform integrating classes, modules, Q&A, achievements, and AI-driven recommendations.
- **Key Features**: Interactive classes, module progress tracking, Q&A inspired by Stack Overflow, gamification, and personalized learning paths.

**2. System Overview (2-3 slides)**  
- **Architecture**: Three-tier (Client → Server → DB), implemented in Next.js on Vercel.  
- **Core Modules**:  
  - Module Management (lessons with videos, docs, quizzes)  
  - Q&A (class/module-related Q&A with AI assistance)  
  - Achievements & Gamification (badges, credits, unlocking free modules)  
  - Personalized Recommendations (AI-driven learning paths)

**3. Use Cases & SRS Summary (2-3 slides)**  
- **User Roles**: Student, Teacher, Admin  
- **Key Use Cases**:  
  - Enroll in class, complete modules, ask questions, answer peers  
  - Earn achievements, gain credits, unlock premium content
  - Receive personalized suggestions for next modules based on progress and Q&A
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: Performance (fast load), Security (OAuth, HTTPS), Scalability (Vercel serverless)

**4. Design Process (2-3 slides)**  
- **Methodology**: Iterative, feedback-driven design  
- **Decisions Made**:  
  - Next.js & Vercel for full-stack simplicity and quick deployment  
  - PostgreSQL for relational data, Vector DB for AI semantic search  
  - Agile approach: modules added incrementally, integrated with Q&A and achievements

**5. Detailed Design Highlights (3-4 slides)**  
- **Database ERD**: Show refined schema highlighting Classes, Modules, Q&A, Achievements, and Recommendations  
- **Module Design**: Emphasize how each module (e.g., Q&A, Achievements) integrates with the database and APIs.  
- **AI Integration**: Explain vector embeddings and how recommendations are generated.

**6. Deployment & Tools (1-2 slides)**  
- **Vercel**: Simple deployment, CI/CD from GitHub  
- **Tech Stack**: Next.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Vector DB API  
- **Security & Testing**: Linting, unit/e2e tests, secure auth handling

**7. Q&A and Wrap-Up (1 slide)**

## Role-Play: Lecturer’s Q&A

**Lecturer**: “How do you ensure that the vector database integration doesn’t slow down the system?”

- **You**: We cache frequent embeddings and precompute recommendations off-peak. The vector store is queried asynchronously, and if it’s unavailable or slow, the UI gracefully degrades by showing basic recommendations without semantic filtering. Also, vector retrieval is optimized by indexing frequently accessed modules.

**Lecturer**: “What if the external AI service changes its API or becomes unavailable?”

- **You**: The system is designed with a clear abstraction layer. All AI calls go through a service wrapper. If the API changes, we update the wrapper. If unavailable, we have fallback logic: show human-curated recommendations or Q&A links based on user’s past data. The platform remains functional without AI suggestions.

**Lecturer**: “Can you elaborate on how you handle real-time updates, like a new answer in Q&A?”

- **You**: While the system primarily uses SSR and server actions, we can integrate Next.js API routes with websockets or use server-sent events. For small-medium scale, we can implement periodic revalidation or leverage polling. For more advanced real-time features, we’d integrate a real-time messaging service (e.g., Pusher or WebSocket server) in Vercel Edge Functions if needed.

**Lecturer**: “How do you ensure the code quality and reliability of each module?”

- **You**: We enforce coding standards with ESLint and Prettier, run automated tests (unit + integration), and require code reviews on GitHub. We maintain high test coverage and have a staging environment on Vercel for QA before pushing to production.

**Lecturer**: “What’s your backup and data recovery strategy for the database?”

- **You**: We rely on managed PostgreSQL that provides automated daily backups, point-in-time recovery, and replication. In case of data corruption, we can roll back to a known good state. The vector database typically also provides backup or we can periodically export embeddings to a safe storage.

**Lecturer**: “How do you plan to handle future scale if usage grows significantly?”

- **You**: Vercel scales serverless functions automatically. PostgreSQL can be upgraded to a larger instance or use read replicas. The vector DB is a managed service that can scale horizontally. We can introduce caching (e.g., Redis) and a CDN for static content. The architecture is designed for modular scaling as demand increases.
