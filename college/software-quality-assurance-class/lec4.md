# Lecture 4: Black Box Testing Approach

## 1. Black box testing

- What
- Some basic characteristics (predictable)
  - abstract away the code, focusing on designing good test cases
- Note: Teacher noted about white box testing lecture being time-consuming to draw and we should print the slides
- compare with white box testing: black box can be used for a wider range of audiences and testing levels
- Some black box testing techniques: to be covered next

## 2. Equivalence class partitioning

- Equivalence class partitioning involves dividing the input domain into classes of data and selecting test cases from each class with some practices and caveats
- May depend on the programmer's experience
- An example
  - We may forgot about invalid inputs, which are also important but may not be specified in the requirements
## 3. Boundary value analysis

- A supplementary technique to equivalence class partitioning
- Some limitations
  - Hard to classify complex input domains or too simple (boolean)

## 4. Decision Table Technique

- A bit stunned and haven't understood what's going on lol

## 5. State Transition Testing
