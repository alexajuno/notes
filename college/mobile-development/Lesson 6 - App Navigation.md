## Multiple activities and Intents

- Using Intent class for switching between activities

## App bar, navigation drawer, and menus

- I'm not sure how to make app bar, navigation drawer, and menus.
    - For navigation drawer, the only thing I know is using DrawerLayout and NavigationView.
    - For menus, I think that it's about using external libraries (androidx or something like that).

## Fragments

## Navigation components

- NavController
- NavHost
- NavGraph
    - Including destionations, actions named action_\<source\>\_to\_\<destination\>

## Custom navigation behaviors

### Passing data

- Define params in the destination
- Passing data using action
- Using SafeArgs to pass data

## Navigation UI

- DrawerLayout and NavigationView
- AppBarConfiguration?
- Back stack
