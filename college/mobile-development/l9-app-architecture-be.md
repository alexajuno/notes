# Lesson 9: App Architecture - Persistance

## Storing data

- App-specific storage?
- Preferences?
- Shared storage
- Databases?
    - SQL and SQLite for Android

- Q: how db differ from shared storage? and db is about storing data in a structured way anyway right?

## Room persistence library

- A library.
- Has annotations: similar to Spring Data JPA
- Q: @dao and @database? Why two annotations are here?

## Async

- N: Going with db communications and heavy computing, easily to be understood.
- Q: Threading and concurrency programming in Java?

### Coroutines

- Q: Jetpack integration for coroutines? But aren't we learning Android Views?

- Q: Suspend/resume modifier?
- Dispatchers: like a thread mananger.
- And many more to come...

## Testing Databases

- A library for testing (Q: just db or whole app, since I saw JUnit here?)
