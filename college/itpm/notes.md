### 3.3 Scope Management

- Collecting requirements
    - Interview skill
    - Listening skill
    - I think this is a huge topic so I'll just note some keywords here: focus group, facilitated group, open/close questions, active listening, etc.
- 2 types of scope:
    - Product scope: what is the product
    - Project scope: how to make the product
- Scope creep problem
- Work breakdown structure (WBS)
    - Similar to sth in user task in ux/ui lol, but more detailed
    - But it seems like this tool is used for the whole project, not just scope management

### 3.4 Time Management

### 3.4.1 Project Schedule

- Define and schedule the activities of a project?

### 3.4.2 Scheduling

- Precedence diagram method (PDM)
- Dependency types: permanent, temporary (...), external
- The solution for dependency is to use critical path method (CPM)
- Critical chain

### 3.4.3 Estimation

### 5.6 Monitoring and Reporting

- We both want to track the progress but also don't want to do adminitrative tasks -> find a balance
