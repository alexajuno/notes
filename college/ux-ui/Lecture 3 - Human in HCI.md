## Human factor

- Quick intro: human parts like computer structure
  - including memory, ram, CPU and emotion
- Research about features of human and how they relate to the interaction with the system
- It seems there are a lot of factors and features
  - But one thing I must confirm that people are diverse and lazy lol
- The downloaded slide is a bit different from the one in the lecture

## Visual Perception

- 90% of information is visual
- So many theories here that I hardly bother to remember. I think someone want to master this subject will need to learn them here
- I can skim through some keywords

- Optical interaction
  - Perception theories: 2
    - Constructivism
    - Ecological approach
  - About eyes and how they work
    - Optical flow: simplification, affordance
    - Color schemes: RGB, SHV, SHL
  - Some interesting keywords to me: hue, saturation of colors, muller misperception

## Other sensations/perceptions

- Hearing
- Touch
- Movement

### Human memory

- Information Processing Theory

  - Types of memory: I feel that this part is relating to biology, I mean it's fun to know some but I wouldn't bother though, because to memorize these info, I need to dig deeper
    - Sensory memory
    - Working memory
    - Long-term memory
      - Two types of LTM: semantic, episodic
      - activities
        - Encryption
        - Storage and forgotten
        - Retrieval

- How we forget things

## Information processing - Retrieval

- Two types: recall and recognition
- A UX Principle: recognition over recall

## Reasoning/Thinking

- Some types of reasonings: logic, contradiction, induction
- And many more theories that I don't bother to memorize

## Emotion

- This is about psychology, about human errors, emotions, etc. that may relate to UX design but I don't bother either
