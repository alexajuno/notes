## Human factor

- Quick intro: human parts like computer structure
  - including memory, ram, CPU and emotion
- Research about features of human and how they relate to the interaction with the system
- It seems there are a lot of factors and features
  - But one thing I must confirm that people are diverse and lazy lol
- The downloaded slide is a bit different from the one in the lecture

## Visual Perception

- 90% of information is visual
- So many theories here that I hardly bother to remember. I think someone want to master this subject will need to learn them here
- I can skim through some keywords

- Optical interaction
- Perception theories
	- Constructivism
	- Ecological approach
		- Q: Why are the lecture giving two one-sided theories instead of just giving a theory that best explain everything?
		-  Optical flow: simplification, affordance
		- Affordance: √°m ch·ªâ nh·ªØng ƒë·∫∑c t√≠nh c·ªßa m·ªôt ƒë·ªëi t∆∞·ª£ng ho·∫∑c m√¥i tr∆∞·ªùng m√† ng∆∞·ªùi d√πng c√≥ th·ªÉ nh·∫≠n ra v√† hi·ªÉu ƒë∆∞·ª£c c√°ch s·ª≠ d·ª•ng.

	- About eyes and how they work
- Color schemes: RGB, SHV, SHL
- Some interesting keywords to me: hue, saturation of colors

## Other sensations/perceptions

- Hearing
- Touch
- Movement
- N: This part was mostly introduction and skipped by me lol.

##  Information Processing Theory

- Sensory memory
- Working memory
- Long-term memory
	  - Two types of LTM: semantic, episodic
- How we forget things: decay and inteference.

## Information processing - Retrieval

- Two types: recall and recognition
- A UX Principle: recognition over recall

## Reasoning/Thinking

- Some types of reasonings: logic, contradiction, induction
- And many more theories that I don't bother to memorize

### C√°ch th·ª©c gi·∫£i quy·∫øt v·∫•n ƒë·ªÅ (?)

- Gestalt Psychology
- Problem Space Theory: kinda like what are applied into very basic AI theories.

## Emotion

- This is about psychology, about human errors, emotions, etc. that may relate to UX design but I haven't read that carefully üò≠
