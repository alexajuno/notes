# HCI and UX/UI

- Roll call the whole class integrated with review questions on previous lecture

## Syllabus

- It seems like we need to make 4-5 questions and send them to the lecturer for the whole semester
- Final exam including multiple choice questions and writing questions (but my friend said it's easy)
