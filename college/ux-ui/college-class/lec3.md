## Human factor

- Quick intro: human parts like computer structure
  - including memory, ram, cpu and emotion
- Research about features of human and how they relate to the interaction with the system
- It seems there are a lot of factors and features
  - But one thing I must confirm that people are diverse and lazy lol
- The downnloaded slide is a bit different from the one in the lecture

## Visual Perception

- 90% of information is visual
- So many theories here that I hardly bother to remember. I think someone want to master this subject will need to learn them here
- I can skim through some keywords

- Optical interaction
  - Perception theories: 2
    - Constructivism
    - Ecological approach
  - About eyes and how they work
    - Optical flow: simplification, affordance
    - Color schemes: RGB, SHV, SHL
  - Some interesting keywords to me: hue, saturation of colors, muller misperception
