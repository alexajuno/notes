# Lecture 4: JS, JSX and ReactNative

- Bonus work for the project: but the teacher doesn't remember what it is lol
- React Native is similar to React, except there are based elements working on mobile development
- Using the same idea as React
  - Components
    - Some components for mobile env like ListView
  - asynchronization in JS
- Lecturer emphasized the client/server model in app development through many lectures. You can't write static apps today lol.
- To create a good UI also requires external dependencies, so it's still best to stick with Flutter lol
- Note: currently using Expo framework, not sure what it is
