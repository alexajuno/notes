## 2. Basic Terms of Software Testing

- A test case

## 4. Testing Levels

- Levels in V-shaped model
- Unit test
  - Dynamic Unit Test Environment: 
    - test driver
    - stubs: indicates that the unit under test was indeed isolated
- Integration testing
  - motives and objectives
  - Interfaces between modules
    - Types of interfaces: haven't read
    - Why errors may happen: we haven't understood each other lol

  - Techniques: haven't read
