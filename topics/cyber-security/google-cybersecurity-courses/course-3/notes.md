# Course 3: Connect and Protect: Networks and Network Security

## Module 1: Networks

### Introduction

- What are networks?
- Network tools?
- Cloud computing
- Cloud network
- About cloud services. I mean we still need network tools to link computers within an org, so when refering to hybrid cloud env, I think the only thing that differ is storage. Is it true?
- Software-defined networks

### Network communication

- Packet
  - Header (ip/mac/protocol number?)
- Bandwith
- Packet sniffing
- TCP/IP
  - TCP?
  - IP?
  - Port
  - TCP/IP model
- OSI model

### Local and wide network communication

- IP address
  - IPv4
  - IPv6
- MAC address

## Module 2: Network operations

### Protocols

- What are network protocols?
- TCP
- Address Resolution Protocol: Mapping IP to MAC within the same network
- HTTPS
- DNS
- Secure Socket layer
- Network Address Translation: private IP -> public IP
- Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol: assigns dynamic IP address for each device
  - DNS Server?
  - Default gateway?
- Telnet
- Secure shell
- Post office protocol

#### Wireless Secure Protocols

- IEEE 802.11: Wi-fi
- Wireless Application Protocol

### System Identification

#### Firewall

- What is a firewall?
- Cloud-based firewall
- Stateful and stateless firewall
- NGFW

#### Subnetting and CIDR

- Security zone
  - Uncontrolled
  - Controlled zone
    - Demilitarized zone
