Today the Flutter project has ended. There were a lot of errors, bugs, mistakes. But I do proud of myself a bit for being the main carry of the team. I still have a lot more to learn, to try, to keep going.
I was tired from overtime work last night so I spent time at home resting and went to Read Station around 4:30 pm.
