## Lecture 7: Data Modeling

![[07-DataModeling.pdf]]

### Summary
- Data modeling
- NoSQL
- Normalization
### Questions
- For the development process, why would we want to design the class diagrams before mapping it to the database design (aka tables)?
- What kinds of relationships would make hierarchical model struggling?
- How are these models being implemented, esp. in modern Information technology?
- Does NoSQL also include network and hierarchical models I guess?
- I haven't understood the column-family storage =(
- I haven't understood about the way NoSQL database having advantages in scale horizontally.

- Doesn't SQL scale that way too?
	- ACID compliance, what is that?
- How does it look like when implementing the key-value pair in-memory database like Redis? I mean why this key-value storage is used instead of others? We can see it in RAM with Redis, and local storage in browser also key-value.
