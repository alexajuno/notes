One time, I even found a cooker in there! It’s baffling to me, and I find it frustrating to deal with. We haven’t talked in over a month, partly because I’ve lost interest in engaging with someone who spends all their time playing video games and constantly puts himself down.

Their attention caught me off guard. It made me shy at first, but looking back, if people enjoy you, they might not make fun or criticize you because of your interests, like T1 fans often make fun out of the Haidilao visiting of T1 members. Even though T1 might wasting my time, sometimes their stories are inspiring.
