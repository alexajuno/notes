- I went to the coffee and book shop early in the morning, but I struggled to focus. I was both distracted by hunger—having only eaten a piece of bread the night before—and constantly scrolling through Facebook.
- When the barista recognized me, I felt shy and nervous. I couldn't stop wondering what they thought of me, coming here so often. Did they think I was wasting my money?
- By 11 a.m., I decided to head back home.
- In the evening, I went to a local rice shop for dinner. However, I couldn’t pay because I couldn’t access the internet to make a bank transfer. The shopkeeper recognized me too, as I go there regularly, and kindly allowed me to pay later.
