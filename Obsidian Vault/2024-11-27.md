- Whenever I think about the upcoming deadlines, I feel stressed. I don't know which word to use, but the only thing I can say is my body is not feeling well. It has always been like that.
- I found ClickUp after asking Chat about the tool for project management, it feels really suite me so far with multi-level tasks and more.
- Even I thought that I spent time for resting, today my health wasn't good with minor headache near my right eye. I wonder if it was my eye that causing the headache.
- Ngan's work time has moved from midday to late night. Today she said to get back home at 1am. That not really good  for her health though. I'm imagining the future of us where she will be even busier than I and I need to do both professional work and chores lol.
- I went to the project management class a little bit. It's lack of students as ever because of boring lectures. Even though I know how good a lecturer is in term of professional but in teaching, the syllabi probably limit them.
- I had lunch near NEU, the place I've come in Sunday with my friend. The food wasn't that good though for a rice meal. But I was very hungry back then.
- I had a small chat with my mom this evening. She talked about a yoga class and invited my for a trial. I will gave it a go.
- I see a friend to get back my helmet. I just found a small happiness seeing him. It's simple as that.
