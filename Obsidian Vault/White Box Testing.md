## About white box testing and comparison with black approach

## Methods
### Control flow testing
All paths > branch coverage > statement coverage
Simple diagram in case being forgetful
### Predicate Testing
predicate >< clause coverage
clause seems to have more test cases but still not fully cover predicate coverage
#### Combinatorial Coverage
#### Active Clause Coverage
##### Active clause
Given a predicate, make some clauses fixed values. The one determines p value is an active clause.
##### Ambiguous in ACC definition resolves
- General
- Restricted
- Correlated
