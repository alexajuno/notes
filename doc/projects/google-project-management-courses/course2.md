# Course 2: Project Initiation

## Module 1: Fundamentals

### Understanding the key components of project initiation

- Things to be achieved: goals, scope, criteria
- Cost-benefit analysis: whether the cost to achieve the goal is worth it
  - About the questions to determine the cost-benefit analysis, I guess when I need it, I'll ask the LLMs
- Key components of project initiation
  - Goals
  - Scope
  - Project deliverables
  - Success criteria
  - Stakeholders
  - Resources: budget, time, materials, people, equipment, etc.
- Project charter

## Module 2: Goals, scope and success criteria

### Identify project goals

- Using SMART method
  - Somehow I kept doing the wrong choice for the question relating to this SMART
- Objectives + Key Results

### Project scope

- Scope requires management - but why do I feel like scope is similar to requirements or something like that? Ah goals.
- Scope creep
- Triad for scope management: scope, cost, time

### Measuring a project's success

- What is lauching a project? It differs from starting a project.
- Landing a project, and the relationship with launching
- Success criteria
  - We need docs to measure the success of a project and communicate it to stakeholders and customers

## Module 3: Working effectively with stakeholders

### Exploring project team roles and responsibilities

- Accessiblity: permanent or temporary disabilities
- Choosing a project team: know who to assign, who fit wit the project. 
  - They can be trained on time, still bring great benefits and not delay the project.
  - Sometimes we can't choose, so that we need to bring the best out of them.
  - We would want people who are interested in the project, who are motivated, who are committed to the project.
  - How many members should we have?
- Project roles
  - Limited human resources requires multiple roles to be performed by the same person.
  - Some roles: team members, customers (different from users), stakeholders, sponsors (?), project manager, etc.
