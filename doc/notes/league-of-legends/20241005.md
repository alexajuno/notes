- Game 1: Smolder
  - Didn't count Renekton's flash. I think I died to him 4 times and he flashed 3 times to kill me. That guy knows how to play the game I guess, but his teammates is kinda bad I must say.
  - Beside that, nothing too bad about this game, my teammates not that good but not that bad. I mean they don't feed relentlessly
  - The Smolder without tear on the beginning is suffering from mana shortage. If it was not the support Teemo on the enemy team, I'm not sure if I can handle the laning phase next time. I mean the Teemo played kinda bad too, no pressure.
  - Graves is much stronger than I expected. He killed everyone with just a few shots but it doesn't affect the final result. Just a note here.
  - My top laner is Moderkaiser and I'm not sure if his macros in mid game wasn't that good. I mean the enemy top laner felt like contributing to the mid game much more. My top laner changed his playstyle later and group with the team. I think this is about Gold elo, maybe near Platinum.
