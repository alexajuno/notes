# HCI and UX/UI

- Roll call the whole class integrated with review questions on previous lecture

## Human-computer interaction

- Some theories that I don't remember lol: something about HCI stages, the domains of knowledge that HCI research on, basic way of finding out UX rules (I think it's testing and collecting user feedbacks)
- Stages of interaction: intention -> selection -> execution -> evaluation
  - Mình nghĩ cần phải có sự so sánh với mô hình khác thì mình mới nhớ được, chứ như này mơ hồ quá
- HCI is a scientific field, including experiments and theories
- HCI Designers is similar to film directors: you have to know all fields, components of a complete product

## UX/UI Design

- What is UX/UI: the names say everything
  - UX solves user's problems
  - UI is about the view only
- The importance of UX Design
- Why do we need UX/UI
- Interaction Design (IxD): intersection of UX and UI
- Teacher said something about game design is more special than other development fields
- Outsourcing doesn't care much about UX
- The principles of UX Design are centered around users

## Process Design

## Syllabus

- Team (3-4 members) doing something related to product and having UX Design I guess
- Teacher wants to communicate via Teams
- I haven't understood about the questions that teacher requests students to do
