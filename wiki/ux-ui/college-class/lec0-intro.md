# HCI and UX/UI

## Human-computer interaction

- Some theories that I don't remember lol: something about HCI stages, the domains of knowledge that HCI research on, basic way of finding out UX rules (I think it's testing and collecting user feedbacks)

## UX/UI Design

- What is UX/UI
- Compare UX and UI
- Why do we need UX/UI
- Interaction Design (IxD)
- Outsourcing doesn't care much about UX

## Process Design

## Syllabus

- Team (3-4 members) doing something related to product and having UX Design I guess
- Teacher wants to communicate via Teams
- I haven't understood about the questions that teacher requests students to do
-
