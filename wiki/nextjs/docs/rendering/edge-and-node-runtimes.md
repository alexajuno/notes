# Edge and Node.js Runtimes

runtimes:=set of libraries, APIs, and general functionalities available during code execution

## Runtime Differences

- Edge runtime: Lightweight, is a subset of Node.js APIs
- Node.js runtime: having full access but slower
- Serverless Node.js: scalable solution and handling more complex computation for Edge runtime but require a bit of time for requests for booting up

## Segmente Runtime Option

Specifying runtime option for each route by declaring a `runtime` variable and export it 
export const runtime = 'edge' // 'nodejs' (default) | 'edge'
