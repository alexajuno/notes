# Lecture 2: Software Metrics

## 2.1 Motivation 

## 2.2 Lines of code

- Somewhat like Clean Code by Robert C. Martin

## 2.3 Halstead's Metrics

- Use the theory on Wikipedia
- The way we calculate ope(x) is depended on our perception. 
- Yeah I think the index is somewhat impractical because optimization is seldomly performed and even if it's being performed, no one would use this kind of metrics. It just provides a sense of complexity and error prone of the code

## 2.4 McCabe Cyclomatic Number
