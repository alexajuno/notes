## 2. Project Management and Stakeholders

### 2.1 Project Manager Responsibilities

- Standing as a bridge between internal and external factors, between higher management and project team(s)

### 2.2 Compare Managers and Leaders

- leader = future, manager = present
- about leadership: for different stages and scales of the project/company, the requirements and responsibilities are different too

### 2.3 Management Styles

- I guess they depend on personality
- Based on knowledge, talent, skills, etc. of the pm

### 2.4 Stakeholders

- Quick intro about stakeholders. Nothing worth taking note.

## 3. Determining factors

### 3.1 Project Success

- Triple Constraints of a Successful Project: cost, time, scope
  - note: wait, isn't time a type of cost?
- What is a successful project is defined by so many classes. So I won't care much about it here
- Some slides were omitted by the teacher
- Lots of failed projects can be made right via proper processes: market analysis, verification & validation, pm, etc.

- Thầy kể chuyện một vài chiêu trò
  - Giữ người tài: cổ phiếu ưu đãi, lương cao cho phần top, giữ lại chất xám bằng cách concrete the values (making documents, etc.)
  - Ý tưởng: viết quy trình cho nhóm cpad 

### 3.2 Project Management Framework

- Just PMBOK lol. Of course we need pms to customize the framework
- Many more frameworks but I'm too lazy

### 3.3 Project Management Processes Groups

- Normal 4 phases bonus monitoring/controlling phase. But I think normally they would combine execution with monitoring

### 3.4 Nine knowledge domains of project managements

- Oh, in this situation, cost is distinguished from time
- I'm too lazy to remember
- I must admit that projecet management is a lot to learn. There are many aspects and to master one domain has already been hard lol
