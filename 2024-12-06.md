- I was waken up by the noise from my roommate playing video games. At that moment, I've decided to move out. It's time for me to find a job, then find a better place to live, alone. I would say that I've played a lot but also worked a lot, but the college deadlines keep pushing me. Currently I found no time for side-projects that can help me with my portfolio.
- I prepared and planned things in the early morning with ClickUp. And then I went to sleep again then woke up very late, like near 9am. After checking some messages about renting rooms, I went to Read Station. Not sure why but I was annoyed by the noise created by some customers and then I wrote a review about Read Station.
- Today, I visited Read Station as usual. It was nice that it wasnâ€™t noisy this time. However, there was no water available on the 3rd floor, so I went to the 5th floor to get a drink. While I was there, I noticed that VTV was filming something, probably interviewing or talking with someone famous. Accidentally, I might have gotten into their frame while grabbing my drinkâ€”hopefully, they can edit it out. ðŸ˜„
