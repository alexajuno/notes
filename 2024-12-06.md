## Daily Notes

- I was waken up by the noise from my roommate playing video games. At that moment, I've decided to move out. It's time for me to find a job, then find a better place to live, alone. I would say that I've played a lot but also worked a lot, but the college deadlines keep pushing me. Currently I found no time for side-projects that can help me with my portfolio.
- I prepared and planned things in the early morning with ClickUp. And then I went to sleep again then woke up very late, like near 9am. After checking some messages about renting rooms, I went to Read Station. Not sure why but I was annoyed by the noise created by some customers and then I wrote a review about Read Station.
- Today, I visited Read Station as usual. It was nice that it wasnâ€™t noisy this time. However, there was no water available on the 3rd floor, so I went to the 5th floor to get a drink. While I was there, I noticed that VTV was filming something, probably interviewing or talking with someone famous. Accidentally, I might have gotten into their frame while grabbing my drinkâ€”hopefully, they can edit it out. ðŸ˜„

I don't know where should I put my notes on today's AI progress learning so I'll just put it here.

## AI Progress Learning

- Project IDX - A cloud editor tool from Google. I don't think it's good because of the cloud-based and 
- Even with 2m tokens context window, Gemini reasoning still not working as well as OpenAI's models
- OpenAI release o1 officially now, but also coming with a new subscription tier named Pro with 200$/month - not really appealing but the benchmarks look really impressive, being able to beat math, competitive programming, etc. is really cool. And it feels like the o1 can reasoning. I'm not sure about the algorithm behind this so it's hard to say.
- I've watched the podcast of Lex Fridman with the Cursor AI team. Feeling like GitHub copilot won't be able to catch up with the idea and speed of an startup like Cursor.
- I tried to install Windsurf but somehow it crashed.
- For the future of AI, I'm not sure about that but it will be like any automation tools, that can do most of the work but we can go up and down in abstraction level. For now, we still need to understand the syntax, the architecture, the idea behind languages and frameworks to use AI effectively.
