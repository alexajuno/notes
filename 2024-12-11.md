## Daily Notes

### General Reflections
- **Home Visit Experience**: After a weekend at home, I realize long car trips are still quite draining for me. They create "dead time" and leave me exhausted, requiring hours to recover. Despite the tiredness, the visit was positive. I stayed neutral during family arguments and focused on keeping my peace.

- **Pressure of Deadlines**: Deadlines, both real and even in games, are starting to weigh on me. I feel the tension building, and it’s a reminder to manage my time more effectively.

- **Relationship Status**: My relationship with Ngân feels stable and strong. While I sometimes wonder if she’s the "best possible" match, she’s undoubtedly the best realistic one for me. The relationship is unlikely to falter, and I’m grateful for that.

### Thoughts on Productivity and Self-Improvement
- **Ngân’s Comment**: Her observation about unemployment and passively spending time (reading and doing nothing) hit me hard. It’s a mixed feeling of shame and self-awareness. I’m aware I’ve tried my best in many areas, but it’s clear there’s room for improvement. This reflection motivates me to work harder, take action, and perhaps withdraw for a while to focus on personal growth before re-engaging with her fully.

- **Academic Reflections**: Watching a video on studying strategies reminded me of the value of "working smart" over "working hard." I admire peers who effectively gather reviews, previous tests, and resources for their studies. It feels like a skill I’ve lacked due to my rigidity and reluctance to seek help. As my time in university nears its end, there’s little room for adopting these shortcuts, but it’s a valuable lesson for future endeavors.

### Key Insights from the Day
1. **Strategies for Learning**:
   - **Work Smarter**: Embrace "standing on the shoulders of giants," using and improving upon existing work. It’s efficient and applicable in both academics and real-world tasks.
   - **Focus on Essentials**: Prioritize the core, examinable content rather than getting lost in less relevant details.
   - **Building Goodwill**: Helping others, especially in university, fosters connections and opportunities. Collaboration often leads to mutual growth.

2. **Self-Reflection on Rigid Mindset**:
   - My unwillingness to engage in group dynamics like asking for test reviews or sharing materials may stem from a rigid approach to learning. While this independent path has strengths, adaptability and openness could enhance my outcomes in the future.

3. **Next Steps**:
   - Start incorporating smarter strategies in day-to-day problem-solving.
   - Actively manage time to reduce the pressure of looming deadlines.
   - Focus on personal growth without external distractions to rebuild confidence and energy.
   - Continue working on solidifying my relationship by being proactive and communicative.

### Closing Thoughts
Today has been a blend of reflection and motivation. The balance between self-awareness and action is crucial, and I aim to bridge the gap with deliberate steps moving forward. Writing these notes helps me stay aligned with my goals and values, reminding me that progress is a journey.
