Let’s make sure you have a solid grasp of the **key points from this lecture** before moving on. I’ll summarize the main topics and give you a quick-review sheet.

### **Quick Summary: HCI & UX/UI Introduction**

#### **1. What is HCI?**
- **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)** focuses on designing systems that allow humans to interact effectively with computers.
- Multidisciplinary field drawing from psychology, ergonomics, computer science, etc.
- HCI aims to make systems:
  - **Usable** (easy to learn and use).
  - **Efficient** (helping users achieve goals quickly).
  - **Enjoyable** (positive experience).

---

#### **2. Importance of HCI**
- Poorly designed systems can lead to:
  - Critical safety errors (e.g., in medical or nuclear systems).
  - Reduced productivity.
  - User frustration and poor quality of life.
- Effective HCI enhances usability and ensures systems are accessible to diverse users.

#### **3. Evolution of HCI Paradigms**
- **Time-Sharing Systems** (1960s): Shared computational resources across multiple users.
- **WIMP** (1970s-1980s): Windows, Icons, Menus, Pointer introduced graphical user interfaces (GUIs).
- **Direct Manipulation (1980s)**:
  - Centralized on visual feedback and intuitive actions like drag-and-drop.
  - Eliminated reliance on abstract commands.
- **Modern Paradigms**:
  - IoT, AR/VR, and voice-based interfaces for natural interactions.

#### **4. Donald Norman’s Six Design Principles**
1. **Visibility**: Important functions should be visible to users.
2. **Feedback**: Users should get immediate feedback for their actions.
3. **Constraints**: Limit actions to prevent user errors.
4. **Mapping**: The relationship between controls and outcomes should be logical.
5. **Consistency**: Design should maintain patterns for familiarity.
6. **Affordance**: Objects should suggest how they are used (e.g., a button looks clickable).

#### **5. Four Components of HCI**
1. **User**: Their behavior, needs, and preferences.
2. **Task**: What the user aims to accomplish.
3. **Tools/Interface**: The medium of interaction (e.g., software, hardware).
4. **Context**: Environment and situation of usage.

---

#### **6. Key HCI Technologies Today**
- **IoT**: Devices like smart homes and wearables.
- **Eye-Tracking**: Detects where users look to improve interfaces.
- **AR/VR**: Immersive environments for productivity and entertainment.
- **Speech Recognition**: Enables voice-based interactions (e.g., Alexa, Siri).

### **Checklist Before Moving On**
1. Do you understand the difference between WIMP and Direct Manipulation?
2. Can you explain why HCI is important and its role in usability?
3. Are Donald Norman’s six design principles clear to you?
4. Do you grasp the four components of HCI (user, task, tools, context)?
5. Can you briefly describe how modern technologies (IoT, AR/VR) are changing HCI?
