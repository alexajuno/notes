### **Summary: Lecture 2 - Usability**

#### **1. What is Usability?**
- **Definition**:
  Usability is the measure of how effectively, efficiently, and satisfactorily users can achieve their goals when interacting with a system or product.
- **Core Attributes (ISO 9241-11)**:
  - **Effectiveness**: Accuracy and completeness of task completion.
  - **Efficiency**: Resources used to achieve goals (e.g., time, effort).
  - **Satisfaction**: User comfort and positive experience.

#### **2. Why Is Usability Important?**
- Good usability:
  - Reduces user frustration.
  - Improves productivity and satisfaction.
  - Minimizes errors.
- Poor usability:
  - Leads to frustration, abandonment, and financial losses.
  - Causes safety risks in critical systems.

#### **3. Usability vs UX**
- **Usability**: Focuses on functionality and ease of task completion.
- **UX (User Experience)**: Includes usability but also considers emotional, aesthetic, and long-term satisfaction.

#### **4. Five Quality Components of Usability (Jakob Nielsen, 2003)**
1. **Learnability**: How easy it is for new users to accomplish tasks.
2. **Efficiency**: How quickly users can perform tasks once learned.
3. **Memorability**: How easily users can reestablish proficiency after a break.
4. **Error Tolerance**: How easily users recover from mistakes.
5. **Satisfaction**: How enjoyable the overall experience is.

#### **5. Usability Engineering Lifecycle**
1. **Identify user needs and requirements**:
   - Analyze tasks, user profiles, and goals.
2. **Set usability goals**:
   - Define measurable goals for effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
3. **Design and prototype solutions**:
   - Create initial designs and involve users early for feedback.
4. **Evaluate prototypes**:
   - Conduct usability testing with real users, refine iteratively.

### **Key Takeaways**
- Usability is a critical aspect of UX that ensures systems are functional, efficient, and satisfying for users.
- The **ISO 9241-11 framework** and **Nielsenâ€™s five quality components** provide structured ways to evaluate and improve usability.
- Usability is not just about avoiding errors but also ensuring that users can achieve their goals with ease and enjoyment.
