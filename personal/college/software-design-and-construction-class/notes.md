# Software Design and Construction

## Info

- No lap in lecture session
- assignments (in class and homeworks)
- No roll call

## Lecture 1: Software Development Process/Introduction

- System vs application software
  - User vs end-user
- The teacher think about the ability to interpret users needs (I think it's related to BA here) is important to computer science major college students
- Compare programmers and software engineer
- The teacher emphasized about application software competitiveness. We need to solve user needs, not just coding
- She said something about Vietnam's companies don't have a clear distinction between programmer, developer and engineer because companies in Vietnam are young
- Business Application Software
  - Including IT system (hardware, network)
- Comparing software lifecycle and software development and software development processes and models
  - Yahoo messenger: a software came to an end
- Software Lifecycle
  - Concept (User need elicitation)
  - Development Environment
  - Software Deployment
    - Stage/UAT Environment
    - Production Environment
  - Software Operation and Maintenance

- Detail about Software Development Process
  - Analysis
  - Design
    - Methods. Teacher stated that the most common way is Object-oriented Analysis and Design
    - Software Design
- It seems that this class will having both software design (with diagrams) and construction (coding + unit tests)

## Lecture 2: Requirement Modeling with Use case diagram

- Sorry, I'm too lazy to read

- Requirements
  - SRS document structure
  - Use case (maybe activity) diagrams
  - Glossary (explain keywords), supplementary materials (non-functional requirements and non-captured use cases), etc.
- Design = diagrams lol (Software Design Diagrams)
  - Methods to design: we would want to learn about how to make UML digrams
  
## Lecture 3: Software Construction 

- Interaction diagram (I'm too lazy to listen)
  - Mentioned something related to alternative flows
