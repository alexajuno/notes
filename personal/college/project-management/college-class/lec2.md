# Project Initiation

## 1. Definition

- Actually the definition of project initiation is not that important. What matter is what we do in this phase
- Things to achieve
  - project's purposes
  - stakeholder's communications
  - barebones of the project via brainstorming
- A more descriptive view of the project initiation: input -> tools and techniques -> output 
  - input: the environment and circumstances
  - output: things that we suppose to dig deeper but I'm too lazy.
- Project charter

## 2. Goals

## 3. Project Stakeholders
