## Introduction

- Network: resources sharing telecommunicatively
  - nodes
    - end points/hosts: server, clients
      - client: access services of servers
      - server: send services to clients
    - switches
      - devices -> switch: LAN
    - routers
    - firewalls
      - can be place inside or outside router
      - there are configured rules in firewalls
      - NGFW
      - host-based firewalls (software) and network firewalls (hardware)

## Interfaces and Cables

- Switches
  - Register Jack - 45
- Ethernet
  - Network protocols/standards
- Speed is measured by bits per second
- Ethernet standards: IEEE 802.3
  - Types of LAN Technology
- UTP Cables 
  - Unshielded: against electrical interference
  - Twisted: against electromagnetic interference
  - Pair
  - 10base-t and 100base-t: 2 pairs: 1-2 and 3-6 form full-duplex
    - Something related to NIC here
    - straight-through cables: 
    - cross-over cables: for same types of devices
      - I haven't understand these types of cables yet. Is this related to physic cables or protocols?
    - Auto MDI-X
  - 1000base-t and 10gbase-t: 4 pairs, bidirectional
  - Can leak signals
- Fiber-optic connections
  - Small Form-factor Pluggable Transceiver
  - Structure: fiberglass core, cladding, protect
  - Multimode fiber
  - Single-mode fiber
    - I haven't understood the mechanics of this one, that leads to differences with multimode
  - Standards
