# Daily

- I don't have much time for daily writing now. I have to rest early and I've been sick for a few day. I write this on the next day, so I will use past tense.
- Yesterday, my girlfriend was really happy because she get a reward for something I don't know how to call it in English. But in short, she invites people to join an app and she got rewards for that.
- My stomach still in a bad state.
