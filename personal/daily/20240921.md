# Daily

This is the first time I've attempted daily writing in the form of a diary. I'm still figuring out how to handle non-breaking lines in code editors like VS Code and Notepad â€“ they're certainly different from word processors like MS Word!

Today, I revisited part of "The Six Pillars of Self-Esteem." The beginning resonated, especially in my current unemployment situation. It reminded me to be more proactive and cultivate higher self-esteem, which will translate into action: sending out CVs, accepting potential failures and rejections, and ultimately growing from the experience. This path will lead me to a job eventually. The book is really good and have many ideas can be applied. I going to finish it this time.
