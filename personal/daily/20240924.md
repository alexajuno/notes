- When going home on my motorcycle, the crowd and the traffic have made a strange feeling in me. I may try to describe it but probably it's not that exact through words. Feel like I'm so small, just a drop of water in the river, being pushed in the middle of the flow. That feeling combining with the exhaustion from late afternoon timing made me sad a little bit. I wonder how my life would be.  
- Beside that, things are just fine, even though there are problems to be solved, I'm going to do my best with the given resources.
