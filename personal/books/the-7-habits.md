### Primary and Secondary Greatness

- We just want the quick fixes, the easy ways but not the hard way, the correct and fundamental way

### The Power of a Paradigm

- About paradigm: what is it, how it affects our lives
  - We seldomly aware of our maps
- We looking at the world subjectively, but facts do exist

### The power of Paradigm shift

- Its impact is huge: massive changes in human history
- Because paradigm is the root of our perceptions

### Seeing and being

- Kinda the same idea above

### The Principle-Centered Paradigm

- Principles of something I haven't known its name: maybe psychology, sociology.
- Comparing principles with values, practices. and stated that principles are solid as stone, not religious.

### Principles of Growth and Change

- I think it's about growth slowly and steady instead of using quick fixes
- The story between the author and his girl. I mean I have a more generic idea of this problem. Basically, it's about responsibility. It's the dad responsibility to (bla bla too lazy to write or don't know how to write)

### The way we see the problem is the problem

### Think Win-Win - Principles of Interpersonal Leadership

#### Six Paradigms of Human Interaction

#### Win-Win or No Deal

#### Five dimensions of win-win (skipped)

### Seek First to Understand, then to be understood

- Character and communication: if u want to influence people, you should understand them first
- Empathic Listening: do I even need this? Then with the emotional flood I felt from others, how can I handle it? 
  - The example was like you are trying to manipulate others with the technique. Hum, I need to think more about the author's mean
- Seek first to understand: the example is a bit weird but overall it's a good advice that we may forgot in daily life
- The advice is good in some situations, esp. in close relationships, in training. But for work-related, social relationships, there are more to get to the solution. I mean after understanding their concerns, which is good, then what do we do? Win-Win thinking probably works in some situations, but probably we don't have that much time for seeking understanding with others. What we need is the result from them. And yes, we can use stewardship delegation but I think it's not about empathy in management, it's about establishing regulations to handle situations that arise. Even with the next step of empathy. Win-Win but it can't violate our fundamental principles. I mean there are situations where win-win for two involved parties but for the society, it causes harm, then where is the philosophy for this? Hum, the win-win or any thing like that can easily be misinterpreted. It's not clear as day in social situations

- The author mentioned about empathic listening takes too much time. Yes, and that's why it's only suitable for very close relationships or some nitch situations

## Habit 6: Synergize - Principles of Creative Cooperation

- I skipped. Actually skimmed a little bit but don't really buy in

## Renewal

- Some dimension for renewal: physical, spiritual, mental, social/emotional
