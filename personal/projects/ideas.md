## Math Education Platform


### Functionality

- Name: JAMC (Just a minor change)

### Thoughts

- I looked for creating a discussing platform or community, then I found that there are tools for making that and I'm getting less optimistic about this project.
- The platform should consist of three things: discussion platform (encouraging self-study and discussion between students, usually good students), base materials (and maybe videos, for supporting basic knowledge and )
- After spending some time to teach even a mathematical team, I found that students don't have the mindset of putting questions, esp. after reading solutions. I wonder if my platform can help.
- I wonder if AI can handle the questioning for us in the future.
- Ok, my platform can help because one way of teaching isn't feasible. Some students might understanding things differently. Hence, we would want open sharing, multiple ways of explaning a solution
- I think my platform should focus on the problem that we haven't solved yet. That is, something like stackoverflow but related to education. About teacher creating classes and putting resources and questions and student ratings, I think there have been good tools for that already.

## Open source browser extension mimic "Momentum"

- Focus session
- Todos
- Music/Sounds

## StorageSense for file management

### Thoughts
- I mean Windows StorageSense can do just fine, but for RevoUninstaller, sometimes it doesn't do the job

### Functionality

- Mostly for cleaning up files that we rarely touch
- Need more research
