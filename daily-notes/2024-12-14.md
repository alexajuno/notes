## Daily Notes

- I went to Read Station at 8:15am.
- The wireframes took 3 hours including breaks to complete about 70% of the works. But I'm too lzay to make it fully complete. Beside, my teammates are a bit lazy too.
- I stayed there until 2pm, then I went to the company. It's as bad as ever, and the task took me like 30min to complete. The free time, I've spent for some topics I written below.
