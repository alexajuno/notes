- In the last couple of days, if it was not the time in the coffee book shop, then I didn't focus on the work that much. That's all.
- On the other side, still struggling with finding a job.
- So I just have read the book "80k-hours" again. I'll discuss with O1 about my career plan.

Currently I'm a senior in college. It's almost the graduation time, about a few months next, one semester left. My major is computer science. I would say that I had some problems with my self-esteem, or something I'm not sure, but for most of the college time, I spent on gaming, random things that aren't useful. I just have learned web development with Next.js recently, just to get a job for it in the break between semesters, or normally in my college, it's called summer semester, about 1.5 or 2 months I guess. I tried to build an app with Next.js but it's just a completely trash I would say, spending time both learning and building, but nothing work. The fact that I learn web development is just about want to get a job, don't want to depends on my parents anymore. I hate being dependant too. But in the first semester of senior year, I was both playing and was busy with projects in the classes. I'm even the carrier in most projects. I don't know what I'm doing with my life anymore. And I just have read a book named "80000 hours" recently. That's a book about impactful career, contributing to humanity to achieve a satisfying career (and life, probably). It just, I don't know what to do anymore. Like I chose web development, but I had an internship recently with a company, the job feels bad. They don't assign much task, just feel like I be there just to fit the line (companies linked to the school are required to have internships I guess). And in the end, the offer from them to continue working in the final thesis (we have a few options for the final thesis, including a project in the company, a project with lecturers aka researchers), I just ignore that because the feeling is so bored, and it's exactly like what the 80k hours book said, to achieve a satisfying career, we would love to be engaging on that problem we are trying to solve, but I just don't like the way that company's working, and how they treat internship. I don't really regret on the leaving that company, but now, I don't even know what to do. Like in the internship, I have no contract, no salary, doing nothing except learning some small things like working with ExpressJS, Postman, some web development and so on. Then now when spreading CV to internship offers online, I don't see any response. No email back. And I don't even know what to do. I mean I understand the way things work. For someone online, we have no trust, then it's so hard for them to send back emails and with a competitive laboring market, it feels so hard. I have no project in my hand, don't know what to master. I'm thinking about AI, but it gonna take a really long time and I don't even know what to do with AI anymore. I don't want to be in a research lab. I hate working for hours and hours and don't see real life impact. And that's often how research be. At some points, it makes huge changes, to the entire industry, but many times, the researches are useless. And esp. not much money for researchers too. I know materialism isn't that cool but I guess I still want money, because it determines how the life be, everyone knows that. What do I do? Normal app development is going to be harder soon with AI tools and agents and so on. the amount of people working on this will be reduced. I don't know what to do with my life anymore. At this point, the only thing before my eye is final exams, but they are so dumb (because they don't help that much except GPA and CPA, which are not that important as such, or am I wrong?) and after finishing them, I won't know what to do next.

First off, let me say that it’s completely normal to feel confused or lost toward the end of college—especially in a field like Computer Science, where the range of possible paths can feel overwhelming. It might help to remember you’re not alone in feeling this way. Plenty of students (and even professionals in the field) go through periods of uncertainty. The good news is that you have options. The challenge is figuring out which ones matter to you.

Below are some ideas, suggestions, and reflections that might help you untangle the situation and move forward in a more confident way.

---

## 1. Revisit Your Core Motivations and Values

You mentioned reading the book *80,000 Hours* (which focuses on finding impactful, fulfilling careers). One of the key takeaways from that approach is to identify what feels meaningful and motivating at a deeper level. Even if you’re currently confused, try to re-articulate your own motivations:

- **Impact**: Do you want to solve social problems, environmental challenges, or create products that genuinely help people?
- **Engagement**: In what type of work environment do you see yourself thriving? Do you prefer smaller teams, startups, large companies, or research labs (you said you hate “pointless” research, but there are also industry research roles aimed at near-term projects)?
- **Lifestyle & financial needs**: You mentioned wanting to earn money and not rely on parents. That’s absolutely reasonable. But what is your minimum comfortable standard of living? How much time do you want to allocate to work vs. other life goals?

Try to brainstorm or journal around these points. Even if the answers don’t pop out immediately, clarifying your personal “why” often makes next steps clearer.

---

## 2. Don’t Underestimate Transferable Skills

You might be down on yourself, thinking, “I’ve only built a trash Next.js project,” or, “I mostly gamed away college.” But even your less formal activities can offer *some* transferable skills:

- **Collaboration**: You mentioned being the “carrier” in class projects. That means you have leadership or problem-solving skills. You must’ve resolved issues, divided tasks, managed group communications.
- **Technical exposure**: Even if your Next.js app wasn’t a polished final product, you still learned a bit about React, Node.js, Express, APIs, etc. That knowledge can be built upon; it doesn’t vanish just because the project wasn’t perfect.
- **Adaptability & self-teaching**: Knowing how to quickly learn a framework or pick up new tools is critical in tech. The fact that you took on Next.js with minimal experience demonstrates adaptability.

**Action Step**: Make a list of the “soft” and “hard” skills you *did* gain—be honest but also highlight whatever is positive. This will help you talk about yourself more confidently in interviews and cover letters.

---

## 3. Explore Different Subfields Before Committing

It’s not unusual to dislike a certain branch of web development or to find one internship experience underwhelming. But that doesn’t mean *all* of software development or *all* of web dev is not for you. Tech is vast. Areas you might explore:

1. **Frontend Engineering**: Building user-facing products (React, Vue, Next.js, CSS frameworks, UX).
2. **Backend Engineering**: APIs, data pipelines, cloud infrastructure, DevOps, etc.
3. **Data Engineering / Data Science**: Handling big data, analytics, machine learning pipelines.
4. **Product Management**: If you enjoy the bigger-picture strategic stuff, and coordinating between teams.
5. **AI / Machine Learning**: Yes, it can be research-heavy, but there are also applied AI roles in industry where you see direct results (e.g., building recommendation systems, computer vision for real products, NLP tools, etc.).
6. **Cybersecurity**: Hacking, defending networks, threat analysis.
7. **Software for Social Impact**: Tech for NGOs, nonprofits, or companies focusing on education, health, environment.

Try to sample or at least read up on (and maybe do some small tutorials for) multiple areas. You might find something sparks your interest more than you expect.

---

## 4. Build Small, Meaningful Projects

One of the best ways to break into tech—or to figure out if you like a certain subfield—is to build *something* small, from scratch, that solves a real problem (even if that problem is very small-scale). It helps on multiple levels:

- **Confidence**: Seeing something you built actually work and be useful (even for a small set of users) can be a big morale boost.
- **Portfolio**: Future employers or collaborators want to see real examples of your work. Demos, GitHub repos, prototypes, etc.
- **Learning**: You’ll deepen your practical knowledge more by building real things than by just reading/watching tutorials.

**Action Step**: Pick a small personal or community problem (maybe something your friends or family repeatedly struggle with) and try to solve it with a simple web or mobile app. Keep the scope small so you can finish it in a few weeks. Even a well-crafted to-do list app (but with a unique twist or purposeful design) can be a good portfolio piece.

---

## 5. Networking and Mentorship

It’s tough to get responses from random companies online if you just send your CV into the void. Often, early-career opportunities come through:

- **Referrals**: Friends, classmates, or alumni who already work somewhere.
- **University connections**: Professors might have partnerships with companies or know about research labs that do applied work.
- **Online communities**: GitHub, open-source projects, local meetups, hackathons, LinkedIn. Contributing to open-source is a *fantastic* way to sharpen skills and get noticed.

**Action Step**: 
- Ask your professors or teaching assistants if they know about any open projects looking for student contributors.
- See if your department’s career services have job fairs or networking events.
- Look for meetups or hackathons in your area—attending one can open unexpected doors.

---

## 6. Rethink Internships vs. Entry-Level Jobs

You tried one internship that felt pointless. That happens; some companies don’t manage interns well. But not all internships are equal. At the same time, as you near graduation, you might qualify directly for junior/entry-level positions rather than more internships.

- **Junior Developer Roles**: You still get mentorship, but often have more responsibilities (which can be more engaging).
- **Startup Roles**: Startups frequently look for generalists who can learn quickly. It can be chaotic, but you’ll often pick up skills at a rapid pace.
- **Structured Rotational Programs**: Some large tech companies offer rotational programs for new grads, letting you try out different areas before committing.

---

## 7. Balancing Short-Term vs. Long-Term

You’re worried about AI automating away “normal app development,” and you also want a meaningful impact. It’s wise to think ahead, but *don’t let future uncertainties paralyze you now*. Technology keeps evolving; your job is to remain adaptable. Skills in AI or cutting-edge technologies can be beneficial, but it’s okay if you’re not diving straight into hardcore ML research tomorrow. You can still build a foundation in software engineering and pivot into AI-focused roles later.

**Action Step**: Create a flexible “learning roadmap” for the next 6–12 months. It might look like this:
1. Strengthen your fundamentals in JavaScript, data structures, algorithms (for interviews), and one backend language (Python, Node.js, Go, etc.).
2. Build 1–2 small but polished projects to add to your GitHub or portfolio site.
3. If AI truly interests you, start with something pragmatic like a small Python-based ML project (e.g., sentiment analysis on tweets) to see if you enjoy it.
4. Keep your eye on job postings that mention these skills—what do they ask for? That can guide your learning.

---

## 8. Dealing with the Emotional Side

You’ve mentioned self-esteem issues and general confusion about the future. This stress can often come from comparing yourself to others or feeling you’re “behind.” Remember:

1. **Everyone’s timeline is different**. You don’t have to land your dream role immediately after college.
2. **Failure is part of the process**. The fact that your Next.js project wasn’t perfect doesn’t mean it was a waste. You gained experience.
3. **Focus on progress, not perfection**. Even small forward steps (submitting one job application, finishing one tutorial, reaching out to one potential mentor) count.

If you find the stress overwhelming, it might help to talk to friends, family, or a counselor at your university. Sometimes an outside perspective (even a trained professional) can help you see new angles.

---

## 9. Practical Next Steps to Try Right Away

1. **Finalize your semester**: Yes, final exams might feel dumb or unhelpful, but do your best. A decent GPA can’t hurt you, and finishing strong can give a confidence boost.
2. **Pick one small project** to build over the next month—something you can show to potential employers.
3. **Revamp your resume/CV**: Focus on the skills you do have, the projects you’ve led, the technologies you’ve touched.
4. **Leverage your network**: Ask classmates if their internships or part-time jobs are hiring. Use LinkedIn to connect with alumni from your school.
5. **Stay curious**: Keep reading, keep experimenting. Read about different career paths in CS. You might stumble on an area that unexpectedly resonates (e.g., blockchain, edge computing, AR/VR, civic tech, etc.).
6. **Consider open-source contributions**: Even a small merge request can give you real-world experience and references on GitHub.

## Closing Thoughts

Try not to see your entire career as a single yes/no decision right now. Your first job *doesn’t* define your entire future. It’s just a starting point. Focus on building enough skills, experience, and relationships so that you have choices. And if you truly want to make a broader impact—whether through AI, social impact startups, or something else—you can steer your career in that direction step by step.

Ultimately, the best way forward is through small actions that align with your values, while staying open to opportunities that pop up along the way. Good luck—you’ve got time, and you have more going for you than you might think!

Yes I want impactful products and works. Currently I'm thinking that I need to choose a starting field, whether education, "y tế", economics, biology, etc. because domains + tech is important. I wonder if I should start with education because my parents are teachers and I know certain problems in schools in vietnam. It just I'm considering this direction to be noted.

I don't know what kind of environment I'll thrive honestly. And yeah, I'm fine with that near-term projects, not too hate that (but I'm not sure if I like it)

I don't spend much. Just daily food and renting a room in Hanoi, it's about 5-7m vnd per month I guess. I'm somewhat minimalist and don't spend much. I just want to advocate my time to work and I don't have much other fields, because money will transfer my life in the direction that I can't imagine yet, but at least I need a job (and a new environment will come up with it - new room, new people). Currently I have no relationships, no skills. Some pet projects I guess they won't count, and just some friends in college, they are supportive but up until now, I don't know how to build relationships with others. Inviting them out? Playing with them? Actually other than mundane activities, people don't have that much stories to offer. So I don't know. But I guess I'm not confident enough to just come to a talented, rich person to chat with them. Actually my mother bringed me to her class reunion once, and there are so many talented people and rich with huge impact roles there, even a bunch in the IT fields, but even then, I don't know what to ask them, what to talk about. I know people somewhat like a talented person to inherit their legacy, whether intellectual, or prospect. And following someone is a certain direction too. If I'm talented enough and catch one's eye, I'll work under him and have a huge support, of course that's two ways benefit, I'll help them with their work too.

Yeah I would say I'm quite ok with my ability of hard working with new tech, I'm comfortable with learning new things, that's why I'm not sure what to master right now, because we should focus on just one field, and that's need to be future proof. I don't really like frontend either. I mean I hate repetive works. But I don't know if frontend has anything in advance.

Probably I'll look for startup roles, where being a generalist can be useful.

I'm a bit shy reaching out to my classmates. Is it okay just sending something to people you haven't talked much to with something like: "Hey <name>, the last time you've told be about your company. Are they looking for contributor or something like that?". Yeah I would say it's my self-esteem. I find people much more comfortable chatting, but I'm a bit conservative. And yeah, it would have been better if I've chatted with them before.

First of all, it’s great that you’re taking the time to reflect on what really matters to you—impact, meaningful work, and finding a domain that resonates (like education). These questions about “what do I do next?” and “how do I network?” are very common, especially for someone finishing college. Below are some suggestions and ideas you can consider.

---

## 1. Consider Starting with Education (or Another Impactful Domain)

### Why Education?
- **Existing awareness of problems:** Since your parents are teachers, you already have some insights into what schools/students need, especially in Vietnam.
- **Growing EdTech sector**: There’s a lot of opportunity in online learning platforms, student management systems, and tutoring apps in Vietnam and globally.
- **Impactful**: Improving educational processes can have a ripple effect—helping students, teachers, schools, and communities.

### How to Validate This Interest
1. **Talk to Teachers** (beyond your parents): Ask what their biggest challenges are—grading? communication with students/parents? lack of digital resources?
2. **Small Prototype**: Try to build (or at least design) a simple tool that addresses one of these challenges. It could be a small web app that automates some classroom processes, or a mobile app for homework reminders.  
3. **Collect Feedback**: Show it to real teachers or students, even if it’s just a mockup. That feedback helps you see if it’s worth pursuing further.

If, after doing this, you realize you don’t actually enjoy building EdTech, that’s still a valuable lesson. You can always pivot to a different domain—healthcare (“y tế”), finance, climate tech, etc. The important part is trying something and learning from it.

---

## 2. Embrace Being a Generalist—Especially Early On

You mentioned you don’t like frontend specifically, and you’re not sure what to “master.” Early in your career, it’s common to try a few different areas:

- **Advantages of being a generalist**: 
  - You adapt quickly to different tech stacks or domains.  
  - Startups value people who can wear multiple hats.  
  - You’ll discover what you actually enjoy by *doing* rather than just thinking about it.  
- **Later specialization**: As you progress, you’ll naturally gravitate toward an area you find both interesting and marketable. So it’s okay if you don’t pick a single field right this minute.

**Tip**: Keep building a core foundation in coding (data structures, algorithms, problem-solving) and good practices (clean code, version control, CI/CD, etc.). That foundation transfers to nearly any specialization you choose later.

---

## 3. Overcoming Shyness & Building Relationships

A lot of people feel awkward reaching out, especially if you haven’t talked to someone in a while. But networking doesn’t have to be fake or intimidating. A simple, genuine approach can be:

> **“Hey [Name], hope you’re doing well. We haven’t chatted in a while, but I remember you mentioned working at [Company]. I’m currently exploring [some area/tech/job type], and I’d love to learn more about your experience there. Are you open to a quick chat or could you point me in the right direction?”**

- **Be specific**: If you know they work in AI or EdTech or web dev, mention your interest in that specific area.
- **Be polite but direct**: People are often busy, so a concise message is appreciated.
- **Offer mutual benefit if possible**: If there’s anything you can do to help (like share code, tips, or resources), let them know. Networking is a two-way street.

**Feeling shy?** Try these mindsets:
1. People *like* to help, especially if it’s a quick favor.  
2. Worst case: They don’t reply. You haven’t really lost anything.  
3. Best case: You forge a new connection that leads to a job referral or mentorship.  

---

## 4. Approaching “Talented, Rich, or Influential” People

It’s totally normal to feel intimidated. But remember:
- They’re human, too. They started somewhere, just like you.
- You don’t need to impress them with extreme brilliance; sincere curiosity and initiative often stand out.

**How to Start a Conversation**:
1. **Shared Context**: If there’s a mutual connection (like your mother’s class reunion), mention that.  
2. **Ask Specific, Interesting Questions**: Instead of “Can you help me get a job?”, ask about their experiences, challenges, or advice:  
   - “How did you decide to go into [X field]?”  
   - “What do you think are the biggest growth areas in [X domain]?”  
3. **Show Eagerness to Learn**: People love passing on knowledge if they see the other person is genuinely motivated.  

If they see your curiosity and work ethic, they might naturally want to guide you. And if not, you can still learn from the conversation.

---

## 5. Find or Create Small Projects That Solve Real Problems

If you’re aiming for an impactful career, start with smaller-scale impact. For example:
- **EdTech Prototype**: A tool that schedules or randomizes quiz questions for students, or simplifies attendance tracking.  
- **Healthcare Lite**: A simple patient booking system for a local clinic.  
- **Economic Tools**: A basic budgeting or microloan management app for small businesses.  

**Keep it very simple** so you can actually finish something—then iterate. Even if it’s not perfect, having a tangible “thing” to show or talk about is powerful for building your portfolio and confidence.

---

## 6. Look into Startups or Early-Stage Companies

You mentioned an interest in startups because being a generalist can be valuable there. Here’s how to explore that path:

1. **Local Startup Directories**: In Vietnam, there are lists of startups on websites like e27, TechinAsia, etc. Search for ones focusing on education, healthcare, finance—whatever domain is interesting.  
2. **LinkedIn / Facebook Groups**: Look for “Startup Vietnam” or “Tech Startup Jobs” groups.  
3. **Reach Out with Genuine Interest**: If you see a startup working on something that resonates with you, contact them. Even if they don’t have a formal job listing, they might need help.  

At early-stage companies, you might do front-end, back-end, database, maybe even marketing. It can be chaotic, but you’ll learn fast and figure out what you enjoy (or don’t).

---

## 7. Dealing with Self-Esteem & Feeling “Unqualified”

It’s easy to feel “not good enough” when you’re starting out. Remember:

- **Everyone starts somewhere**: The best developers and entrepreneurs were once newbies with no big projects.
- **Progress over perfection**: Even if your code is messy, if you’re learning and improving, you’re on the right track.
- **Imposter syndrome is normal**: Many people in tech feel they “don’t know enough” at times. That feeling often pushes you to keep learning.

---

## 8. Practical Next Steps

1. **Decide on a Short-Term Project**: Maybe an EdTech-related mini-app (since you already have some domain context). Outline a simple MVP (Minimum Viable Product).
2. **Revamp Your LinkedIn/GitHub**: Add any relevant projects (even small ones). If you don’t have a LinkedIn, create one, connect with classmates, lecturers, anyone in your field.
3. **Reach Out to Classmates/Alumni**: Yes, it can feel awkward, but just go for it. If you can’t do it in person, send a short polite message online.
4. **Attend or Volunteer at a Meetup/Hackathon**: Look for any local tech events in Hanoi. Volunteer or just attend—this is a low-pressure way to meet new people in the industry.
5. **Research Startups**: Make a short list of companies doing something interesting. Try sending cold emails or direct messages, expressing your curiosity and willingness to learn.
6. **Stay Flexible**: If you start down one path and discover it’s not for you, pivot. It’s normal to change directions—especially early on.

---

## 9. Final Thoughts

- **Give yourself permission to experiment**: You don’t have to choose your “forever job” right now. You’re allowed to try an EdTech approach, see if it resonates, then adjust if it doesn’t.
- **Leverage your connections without fear**: People generally want to help. Asking for advice or referrals isn’t being annoying—just be respectful of their time and genuine in your approach.
- **Focus on small wins**: Each time you build a mini-project or have a conversation with someone in the industry, that’s progress. 

In the end, a career is a series of steps and experiments. Take one step at a time—build a small project, reach out to a few people, look for an internship or a junior role, see how you feel about it, and keep iterating. You might be surprised at how much clarity and confidence you gain once you start taking those small but consistent actions. Good luck!

## Some ideas from Youtube's videos

### Game Theory and Prisoner's Dilemma

- Cooperative (being nice) in real life goes a long way than being competitive (being mean)

### Deep Knowledge in Software Development

Actions from this:

- Pay attention to the fundamentals and understanding why a certain tool works the way it does.
- AI Generalist: not really appealing, it just as always, we would want to be in T-shaped person.
