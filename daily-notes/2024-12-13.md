I visited the Kham Thien Giam book and coffee shop again today, using a free voucher to try a cappuccino. It was my first time drinking this type of coffee, but honestly, I couldnâ€™t taste much. It felt like mostly ice with just a hint of coffeeâ€”kind of like drinking the last diluted drops of coffee at Read Station. Not a great experience at all ðŸ˜­.
Feeling like I'm making things more complex while learning UX/UI lectures. It takes so long time to study just one lesson, and I wonder how the final exam would look like.
Write three positive things at the end of the days sounds cool. I just have read that on 7 Cups.
