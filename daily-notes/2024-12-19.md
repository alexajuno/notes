**Opening Thought:**  
"Today's experiences seemed mixed, with some frustration over academic expectations and moments of personal productivity and indulgence."

**Reflections and Insights:**

- **Your Reflection:** "In the morning, I prepared and presented my thesis idea to my lecturer. I felt it was a waste of time since he didn't engage with the system itself and instead focused on unexplained design steps, which left me disappointed."  
    **My Perspective:** "It's frustrating when efforts feel unappreciated, especially in academic settings. This could be an opportunity to seek clarity on expectations beforehand or consider refining how to present your ideas to align with their priorities."
    
- **Your Reflection:** "In the afternoon, I played Genshin Impact or chess and took a nap. My dinner was light because I felt full, and I spent the evening working on Stashify wireframes."  
    **My Perspective:** "Balancing leisure and productivity is crucial. It's great you worked on wireframes despite feeling off. Perhaps incorporating mindfulness in your evenings could help you manage energy better."
    
- **Your Reflection:** "Later, I used my phone for too long, which delayed my sleep until 11:30 p.m., even though I went to bed early."  
    **My Perspective:** "Phone usage before bed can disrupt sleep quality. You might benefit from a wind-down routine or using apps that limit screen time in the evenings."
    

**Learnings and Actions:**

- Clear communication about expectations with lecturers can help minimize frustration.
- Recognize and plan for low-energy periods by scheduling lighter, more enjoyable tasks.
- Implement a digital detox routine an hour before bedtime to improve sleep patterns.
