- I woke up at 7:30am, playing with the laptop a bit, had the breakfast at 8am for while. Then the construction next door was running again and I decided to go to Read Station, but even here were noisy too.
- I've experienced the latest version of Cursor, it feels really really amazing, and this is defninitely the new future of programming. I don't know what I'm going to do anymore. I'm about to lose my job =).
- I tried the first lesson of CS50: Introduction to Computer Science this morning. I would say that Prof. Malan hit differently than courses in HUST, as always. He's an awesome computer scientist.

    **My Perspective:** "Negotiation in relationships doesn’t always mean material or tangible offerings. Emotional support, shared values, and authenticity are equally valuable. Perhaps focus on personal growth that feels fulfilling to you, as this naturally attracts meaningful connections."
