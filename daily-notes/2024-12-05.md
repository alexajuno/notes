I started the morning at the Read Station, as usual. It was as good as ever until the construction noise began rumbling beside everyone's ears again. It felt absolutely unbearable, so I decided to go home for lunch before heading to my UX/UI college class.

During class, I spent most of my time searching for a replacement spot. The search felt endless, but finally, I found the second facility of the Read Station. And wow—it’s amazing! Honestly, it feels even better than the current one. I’m so excited to be here!

Even though the day went with some small exciting things, I don't feel like I have the energy to record it here. Sorry. But the day indeed went through many things and thoughts.

I’ve been using a new office chair, and honestly, it’s way better than any chair I’ve ever used before. But here’s the thing: I’m not used to this type of chair. It feels like the center axis isn’t entirely fixed, which makes me wonder if it’s a feature or a flaw. Sometimes, I’m afraid I’ll tip over backward.

I think this uneasiness comes from my past experience. I once had a chair that broke at the joint between the seat and the base, and now, I can’t help but associate this tilting with that incident. The thing is, this new chair isn’t faulty at all—it’s just designed differently. Still, it’s hard to shake that feeling.
