# Daily

- Honestly recently for school works, I haven't had much time for personal works like courses or projects. Most of the tasks are added to Google Calendar
- But I can tell that this day was an easy day for me. I was sitting too much, even want to vomit for that. My stomach scrumbling all day. I went to the toilet more than 7 times. My study was that effective and there were many things I didn't accomplish as I expected. I know I shouldn't hope much and expecting too much out of a day, but I do find myself being ineffective and there were hardship.
