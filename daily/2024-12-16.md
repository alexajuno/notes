## Daily Notes

- I work up at 6am this morning. Hopefully there won't be noise from the next door construction. A few days recently, I don't really found them to be too noisy.
- Suddenly I feel stressed and pressured with all the deadlines upcoming. 
- I just talked to Ngan a little bit and I told her I didn't receive the call last night. And she told me that I made she feel like I'm telling her making things up. I didn't mean that and the way she talked exhausted me, even though I need to focus on the works. I'm exhausted right now.
- Today there ain't much people in Read Station. Beside, here mostly men, not much women.
