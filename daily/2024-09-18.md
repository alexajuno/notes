- Yesterday I still spent a lot of time playing games. I need to be more brave to face the challenges of life.
- My girlfriend is supportive to me
- When helping the AOE team to create a virtual LAN, I felt quite satisfied. That's the happiness coming in, when you feel yourself is valuable 
- I felt emptyness and sadness inside me. But no worry, that's how life is. My dad told me about a suicidal case of a student. I'm in no position to judge her but for me, let's be more brave to face sadness.
