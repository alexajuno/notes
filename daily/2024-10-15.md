- I've come to the coffee book shop again. The piano on the 4th floor isn't available due to events holding there, a bit of misery here. But aside from that, the pricing is even better than before with discount for students. That's weird, without discount, I think I'll spend lest money being here lol. Like having the discount, I spent even more.
