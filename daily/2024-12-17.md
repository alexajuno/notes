## Daily Notes

- I woke up at near 7am and played Genshin Impact for 1 hour, then I went to Read Station and work with the design documentation for JAMC project.
- At Read Station, I saw a lot of beautiful girl, both in outlook and the in term of hard-working. I think there must be so many girls like that, why I haven't seen them much yet, in a shared environment like workplace, clubs, etc.
