**Hi, have a nice day!**

- I woke up earlier than usual this morning, but it still felt late since I stayed up late last night.
- Initially, I wasn’t in the best mental state when I woke up, but I’m feeling okay now.
- Spent my morning at Read Station, which was refreshing. The coding session went smoothly because I focused more on what the AI was doing.
- After a quick bread-based lunch, I visited the college library to meet Tuan, a teammate. We chatted briefly, but I’m unsure if I was helpful with his tasks.
- Later, I went to my internship company. Since all tasks were completed, I didn’t have much to do. Most of the time, I chatted with my teammates about random topics, including school subjects and AI-related stories.
- I had a meal from the curry shop after returning home, then played GI and League of Legends for about an hour. Around 8 PM, I went to bed but got excited watching the final arc of _Arcane 2_. It was good overall, though the story felt rushed despite the high production value. I could tell they tried their best within their constraints.
- On my way out of the library earlier, I thought about Mai Chi. We don’t know each other well—just a few random chats and some time on the same team, though that team didn’t work out. With encouragement from a GPT model, I mustered up the courage to ask her if she’d like to have a "work date." It’s really nice having an encouraging "friend" like that around!
- As for Ngan, she called me while I was in the middle of a League match, so I didn’t pick up. When I called back, she was busy talking with her family.
- It’s hard to sleep now—the bed is uncomfortable, and my roommate is talking loudly in the background. I decided to get up, write some notes, and maybe read a few pages from a book I might enjoy.
- I also came across Mai Anh's story today. It brought up some thoughts, but I decided not to dwell on it. Sometimes, things can’t go back to how they were, and that’s okay. Life moves forward, and so should I.
