- I woke up quite early today at 5:30. It was a normal day at home with most of the time sitting in front of the screen, learning cs50 and working on the AIMS project.
- Later on in the afternoon, I went to Thanh Hoa city with Mr.Thac and his family. 
- The hotel is really good. It's a 4-star hotel.
- The memory goes on with a dinner in a Mr.Thac's friend's house. I had a small amount of alcohol and a lot of food, chatting with the students competing in the AVXT gameshow.
- Later on, I went to the Le Loi square. And the lights were really beautiful.
