# Daily

- Last night was not as good as I should make it be. Recently, I've spent too much time on Facebook. It's best to just lock it down. Locking it down isn't that possible though. I'll limit the time I spend on it up to 10mins
- I go to the coffee shop today. I think I'll spend the rest of the day there after waking up.
