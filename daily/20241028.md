# Daily

- I still wake up late today. Like several days recently. I was stayed up late at night, watching non-sense videos. I don't know, that's kinda bad. 
- For the morning, I've worked a little bit on the documentation for JAMC and edit some code for CPAD project, beside that, not much have been achieved.
- Then I come to the coffee shop late. It's crowded here. Some people left the room, putting their stuffs on the table. Even for the 2nd floor, it's not ideal either, but I think I'll get down there.
- I've spent sometimes reading about love. I guess I wouldn't want to say being with someone forever, marrying them is a good choice. I guess I would reserve that sentence for someone I find suitable for a healthy relationship.
