Today I subscribed to ChatGPT Plus and I'm starting to working on JAMC and everything. I'm excited to see how it can help me with my work. ChatGPT is much better than Gemini Advanced 1.5 Pro in term of understanding and generating. It's just not that up-to-date and doesn't integrated with Google Products.

Ngan isn't upset with me anymore but I'm owing her two plushies now lol.

Yesterday I played League of Legends until the early morning. I'm getting better at jungling now, doing decent every single game with Viego. I used to farming in the jungle too much, thinking farming then helping. But it's about timing to gank.
