## Daily Notes

- I've come to a coffee book shop today.
    - A small funny story is some people here are asleep, but they opened a high beat song.

- **SQA Test:**  
  Reflected on my approach to the test. I was confident but might have been overly casual by skipping steps and discussing it with a friend. Even though I’m prepared to accept the outcome, I’m worried about the possibility of failing.  

- **Class Diagram Issue:**  
  Faced disappointment when my system design presentation was disregarded for not including a class diagram. Struggled to represent a component-based architecture using traditional UML, as the components communicate directly with the server.  

- **Reflections from the LLM:**  
  - Need to balance my confidence with thoroughness, especially in unfamiliar topics.  
  - Modern architectures might not align with traditional methods, but I can work on creating hybrid representations to meet expectations.  
  - Despite frustrations, I aim to learn from feedback and improve.
