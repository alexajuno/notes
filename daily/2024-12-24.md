## Daily Notes

- Morning Reflections
I woke up late today, likely due to having caffeine too late last night. After a brief session on my laptop—playing Genshin Impact, browsing 7 Cups, and doing a basic setup on ClickUp—I headed to Kham Thien Giam, my usual coffee book shop. Surprisingly, it was much less crowded than usual; at 8:30 am, it’s typically packed.

As the day progressed, two groups arrived, creating a noisy atmosphere. Next time, I’ll head straight to the 4th floor to avoid such distractions.

- A Quiet Escape That Wasn’t
Even on the 4th floor, I couldn’t fully escape the noise—a pair of people chatting broke the silence. It reminded me of my high school days on the math team, where classmates would talk endlessly while I focused on studying. That same sense of frustration and resentment I felt back then surfaced briefly today.
