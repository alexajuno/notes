# Daily

- I don't even have the energy to write anything now. The day was a normal day I suppose. New things learned, normal experiences of life. 
- Morning: coffee book shop till lunch
- Afternoon: lost my keys, go home then back to coffee book shop again, but feeling tired and not that productive
- Calling Ngan after a while, have some fun but being given the cold shoulder lol
- The sticker on Facebook Messenger is cute though
