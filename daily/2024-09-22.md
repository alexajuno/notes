Such a headache Sunday. I haven't known the reason but maybe I stayed up late last night and didn't get good sleep with the alarms to get up on time

I worked in the afternoon and in the evening, I was drain. I spent some time playing League of Legends, then I went to sleep. My girlfriend called me after spending time with her friends. I talked with her for a while, then I went to sleep.
