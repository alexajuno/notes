- I come to the coffee shop again, three days consecutively.

- Onboarding bug
  - Debugging/problem solving process
  - VS Code debugger
  - `e.preventDefault()` solved the problem
  - shadcn/ui
  - update the schema using MTI User

- Reached handleSubmit but doesn't trigger the onSubmit
  - what is handleSubmit in react-hook-form?
  - the error wasn't logged in the console. After the log success, the debugging was much easier.
