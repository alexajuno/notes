# Daily

- It's been a while since my last daily note. I'm not sure how to put it lol.
- I've slept early last evening so today is an early day for me from 1:00 AM.
- Everything was fine, it just recently the world seems a bit darker to me, I mean it has always been there, but the way I feel depends on the information I absorb. I guess I'm using social media a bit too much, not that much but I mean, it's never been beneficial to be used.
- Things are decent, except that this week I skipped some classes but half of the classes was cancelled. 
- Today we will see my classmates and have a lunch together after a while, like 2 years before. Now people can be really busy with their own life, and I'm not sure if this meal will solve anything or ever happen again.
