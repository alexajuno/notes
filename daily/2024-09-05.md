## Notes

- Honestly this day I haven't done well. In the morning I lost my concentration for about 30-60min to Youtube. It's not good at all. In the afternoon, I spent time for my mom's math team and it took me about 3 hours both preparing and sharing. In the evening, found myself playing football with teachers in my high school and too tired. I tried to get back home as early as possible but my house was lost the electricity. Kinda sad. I'll try my best the next day
