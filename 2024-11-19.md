## Experience

- Attended the mock presentation in CPAD class today. Some ideas were discussed and notedâ€”it was kind of okay.
- The experience of picking up, parking, and driving in Hanoi is still just as terrible as everâ€”classic Hanoi!
- After class, I went back home, bought some bread, and mentioned to the shop owner that the quality of their bread has gone downhill. I told her I wouldn't keep buying from them if this loaf doesnâ€™t meet my expectations either. Her reaction? She shifted the blame to whoever made the bread, even though Iâ€™m pretty sure sheâ€™s the owner.
- At the Station Coffee bookshop, the 3rd floor was already crowded before 10 a.m., so I had to move down to the 2nd floor, where the chairs arenâ€™t as comfortable. I used to think Hanoi people donâ€™t wake up early, but it seems once they do, finding a seat becomes a challenge.
- On the 2nd floor, people were free to chat, and I overheard a groupâ€”probably coworkersâ€”talking. It made me reflect on something: Iâ€™ve always imagined company employees to be more polished or knowledgeable, maybe even more inspiring in how they express their perspectives. But listening to their conversation, I felt a little surprised; they didnâ€™t match the image I had in mind. Perhaps my expectations were too high, or I was looking for something specific. Either way, it reminded me that I still have a lot to learn, but also that people arenâ€™t always what we imagine.
- **Motion vs. Notion:**Â Motion seems like an amazing tool, but I havenâ€™t explored it fully yet. After some thought, I decided to cancel the trial. Life is unpredictable, and for now, Notion feels sufficient for managing tasksâ€”even if Motion might offer more. Maybe Iâ€™ll revisit it in the future when I can make the most of its features.
- **SQA Class:**Â After the coffee bookshop session, I went to my Software Quality Assurance class. The theories were fine, though there were the usual controversial points. On the bright side, I had some nice conversations with friends, which made the experience better overall.
- **Bread Shop Hangout:**Â After class, I went to a bread shop with a friend (a cozy spot with bread and beverages). We chatted about random topics in life and ended up discussing some interesting questions and ideas. Looking back, I wish I had recorded the conversationâ€”there were some gems in there! Professionally, my friend asked me a lot of thoughtful questions. It made me realize how much I still have to learn, but thatâ€™s exciting in its own way. ðŸ˜Š
